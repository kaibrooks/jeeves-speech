puffin stuff, aiyyo Snoop, you're up
Let these niggaz know that niggaz don't give a fuck!



This is just a small introduction to the G Funk Era
Everyday of my life I take a glimpse in the mirror
And I see motherfuckers tryin to be like me
Every since I put it down with the D-R-E



Foamin at the mouth and waggin his tail
Searchin through the yards with a keen sense of smell
Lookin for the business in heat
And when he find it he'll be sniffin her seat
We travel in packs and we do it from the back
How else can you get to the booty?
We do it Doggystyle, all the while we do it Doggystyle
Yo motherfuckin hoes!!!
He fucked the fleas off a bitch
He shaked the ticks off his dick
And in the booty, he buries his motherfuckin bone
And if there's any left over
He'll roll over and take a doggy bag home

Damn, that Tanqueray is talkin to a nigga
I ain't bullshittin, one of y'all niggaz gotta get it
Man I got ta piss
Breath test?

I'm serious nigga one of y'all niggas got some bad motherfucking breath
Oh man aye baby, aye baby, shit,
Aye baby get some bubblegum in this motherfucker or something
Aye, nigga, get something to eat, dog
Study long, study wrong nigga

With so much drama in the L-B-C
It's kinda hard being Snoop D-O-double-G
But I, somehow, some way
Keep coming up with funky ass shit like every single day
May I, kick a little something for the G's
And, make a few ends as I breeze, through
Two in the morning and the party's still jumping
'Cause my momma ain't home
I got bitches in the living room getting it on
And, they ain't leaving 'til six in the morning, six in the morning
So what you wanna do, shit
I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too
So turn off the lights and close the doors
But—but what?—we don't love them hoes
So we gon' smoke a ounce to this
G's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this


Rolling down the street, smoking indo, sipping on gin and juice
Laid back with my mind on my money and my money on my mind

Now, that I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in
Now this type of shit, happens all the time
You got to get yours but fool I gotta get mine
Everything is fine when you listening to the D-O-G
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he
Who listens to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
And get to macking to this bitch named Sadie
Sadie?
She used to be the homeboy's lady
Oh, that bitch
Eighty degrees, when I tell that bitch please
Raise up off these N-U-Ts, 'cause you gets none of these
At ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound, feel the breeze
Bitch, I'm just


Rolling down the street, smoking indo, sipping on gin and juice
Laid back with my mind on my money and my money on my mind

Later on that day
My homie Dr. Dre came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat ass J, of some bubonic chronic that made me choke
Shit, this ain't no joke
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
Tanqueray and chronic, yeah I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stopping, I'm still popping
Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me, not with a cherry on top
'Cause when I bust my nut, I'm raising up off the cot
Don't get upset girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you hoes, I'm out the door
And I'll be


Rolling down the street, smoking indo, sipping on gin and juice
Laid back with my mind on my money and my money on my mind

Rolling down the street, smoking indo, sipping on gin and juice, bitch
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind
Rolling down the street, smoking indo, sipping on gin and juice, bitch
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind

But for those who with me, sing that shit

La Di Da Di, we likes to party
We don't cause trouble, we don't bother nobody
We're, just some niggaz who're on the mic
And when we rock up on the mic we rock the mic (right)
For all my Doggs keepin y'all in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
Cuz it's cool when ya cause a cozy conditionin
Which we create, cuz that's our mission
So listen close, to what we say
Because this types of shit happens every-day
I woke up around 10 o'clock in the mornin
I gave myself a strech up, a mornin yawn and
went to the bathroom to wash up
I threw some soap on my face and put my hands up on a cup
and said um "Mirror mirror, on, the wall
Who is the top Dogg of them all?"
There was a rubble dubble, five minutes it lasted
The mirror said, "You are you conceited bastard"
Well that's true, that's why we never have no beef
So I slipped off my khakis and my gold leaf
Used Oil of Olay, cuz my skin gets pale
And then I got the file, for my fingernails
I'm true to the style on my behalf
I put some bubbles in the tub so I can take a bubble bath
Clean, dry, was my body and hair
I threw on my brand new Doggy underwear
for all the bitches I might take home
I got the Johnson baby powder and Cool Water cologne
Now I'm fresh, dressed, like a million bucks
Threw on my white sox, with my all blue chucks
Stepped out the house, stopped short, oh no
I went back in, I forgot my indo
Then I dilly (dally) I ran through an (alley)
I bumped into this smoker named (Sally) from the (Valley)
This was a girl playin hard to get
So I said "What's wrong?" cuz she looked upset
She said um

It's all because of you, i'm feelin said and blue
You went away, now my life is filled with rainy days
I love you so, how much you'll never know
Cause you took your dope away from me
A-huh, a-huh, ahuh

Damn, now what was I to do
She's cryin over me and she was feelin blue
I said, "Um, don't cry, dry your eye
And here comes your mother with those two little guys"
Her mean mother steps then says to me "Hi!!"
Decked Sally in the face and punched her in the eye
Punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet
Slammed the child on the hard concrete
The bitch was strong, the kids was gone
Somethin was wrong I said, "What was goin on?"
I tried to break up, I said, "Stop it, just leave her!"
She said, "If I can't smoke none, she can't either!"
She grabbed my closely by my socks
So I broke the hell out, and I grabbed my sack of rocks
But um, they gave chase, they caught up quick
They started cryin on my shoes and grabbin my dick
and sayin.

Why don't you give me a play
So we can brake it down the Long Beach way
And if you give me that okay
I'll give you all my love today
Doggy, Doggy, Doggy, can't you see
Somehow your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your jazzy ways
Doggy Dogg, your love is here to stay

And on and on and on she kept goin
The bitch been around before my mother's born!
I said, "Cheer up!" so I gave her a hit
I said, "You can't have me, I'm too young for you bitch!"
She said, "No you're not," then she starts cryin
I says I'm nineteen, she says, "Stop lyin!"
I says, "I am, go ask my mother
And with your wrinkled pussy, I can't be your lover"
Yeah, uhh, tic toc you don't stop
And to the, ah tic toc and you don't quit
Yeah, tic toc and ya don't stop, and to the

As I look up at the sky
My mind starts trippin, a tear drops my eye
My body temperature falls
I'm shakin and they breakin tryin to save the Dogg
Pumpin on my chest and I'm screamin
I stop breathin, damn I see deamons
Dear God, I wonder can ya save me
I can't die Boo-Boo's bout to have my baby
I think it's too late for prayin, hold up
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started sayin
"Bring your lifestyle to me I'll make it better"
How long will I live?
"Eternal life and forever"
And will I be, the G that I was?
"I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dreamed of
So relax your soul, let me take control
Close your eyes my son"
My eyes are closed



Murder murder was the case that they gave me
Murder murder was the case that they gave me



I'm fresh up out my coma
I got my momma and my daddy and my homies in my corner
It's gonna take a miracle they say
For me to walk again and talk again but anyway
I get, fronted some keys, to get, back on my feet
And everything that nigga said, came to reality
Livin like a baller loc
Havin money, and blowin hella chronic smoke
I bought my momma a Benz, and bought my Boo-Boo a Jag
And now I'm rollin in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rad
"Just remember who changed your mind
Cuz when you start set-trippin, that ass mine"
Indeed, agreed proceed to smoke weed
Never have a want, never have a need
They say I'm greedy but I still want mo'
Cuz my eyes wanna journey some more, really doe (check it out)

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord, my soul to keep
If I should die, before I wake
I pray the lord, my soul to take

No more indo, gin and juice
I'm on my way to Chino, rollin on the grey goose
Shackled from head to toe
25 with an izzl, with nowhere to gizzo, I know
them niggaz from the other side recognize my face
Cuz it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
Mad doggin niggaz cuz I don't care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggaz stare as I enter the center
They send me to a leval 3 yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scrapin on the floor
Niggaz gettin they shanks, just in case the war, pops off
Cuz you can't tell what's next
My little homey Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck
And he probably won't make it, to see twenty-two
I put that on my momma, I'ma ride for you Baby Boo

Six million ways to die, choose one



It's time to escape, but I don't know where the fuck i'm headed
Up or down, right or left, life or death
I see myself in a mist of smoke
Death becomes any nigga that takes me for a joke
We hit a five dollar stick, now we puttin in work
Unaccountable amounts of dirt, death becomes all niggaz
anybody killa, you know what the deal is
Nigga, you know what the real is

I see some mark brand niggaz on the corner flaggin me down
Sayin, "Yo Daz, what's up with the Pound?
Is that nigga snoop alright? Aiyyo what's up with the crew?
Is them niggaz in jail, or are them niggaz through?"
i said, if you ain't up on thangs
Snoop Dogg is the name, Dogg Pound's the game
It's like this they don't understand
It's an everyday thang, to gangbang
Make that twist, don't be a bitch, let these niggaz know
What's up with you I represent the Pound and Death Row
And can't no other motherfucker in L.A. or Long Beach
and Compton, and Watts, see D-O-G's
Now, you can't come and you can't run, and you can't
see long to the G of the gang
One gun is all that we need, to put you to rest
Pump pump, put 2 slugs dead in your chest
Now you dead then a motherfucker, creepin and sleepin
6 feet deep in, fuckin with the Pound is

 Suicide, it's a suicide



The cloud becomes black, and the sky becomes blue
Now you in the midst of the Dogg Pound crew
Ain't no clue, on why the fuck we do what we do
Leave you in a state of paranoia, oooh
Don't make a move for your gat so soon cuz
I drops bombs like Platoon (ay nigga)
Walk with me, hold my hand and let me lead you
I'll take you on a journey, and I promise I won't leave you
(I won't leave you) until you get the full comprehension
And when you do, that's when the mission
or survival, becomes your every thought
Keep your eyes open, cuz you don't wanna be caught
Half steppin with your weapon on safety
Now break yourself motherfucker 'fore you make me
take this 211 to another level
I come up with your ends, you go down with the devil
Now roam through the depths of hell
Where the rest your buster ass homeboys dwell
Well

 Suicide, it's a suicide

Now tell me, what's my motherfuckin name
Serial killa, serial killa, serial killa

(Wake up in the morning, to Lucky Charms cereal)



Deep, deep like the mind of Minolta, now picture this!
Let's picnic inside a morgue
Not pic-a-nic baskets, pic-a-nic caskets
And I got the machine, that cracks your fuckin chest plates
open and release them guts
Then I release def cuts
Brutal, jagged edged, totally ruffneck
Now everybody scream nuff respect to the X
Nuff respect given
Disrespect and you will not be livin
Word to momma, Emma, drama, dilemma

 Suicide, it's a suicide

Now tell me, what's my motherfuckin name
Serial killa, serial killa, serial killa

What's a girl to do
Take out a crew, or two, a few, what you wanna do?


Throw your guns in the motherfuckin air, we don't care

Niggaz don't give a fuck nigga

About nuthin at all, just my Doggs and clockin the grip bitch

Niggaz don't give a fuck nigga

That's why I can kick it so tuff, cuz when times get ruff, my

Niggaz don't give a fuck nigga

The clique i'm with, don't give a sheeit, ya know why?

Real niggaz don't give a fuck


You're back now at the jack-off hour this is DJ, Eazy Dick
On W-Balls, right now, somethin new, by Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one goes out to the ladies, from all the guys
A big bow wow wow, cuz we gonna make it a little mystery
here tonight, this is DJ Eazy Dick, on the station that
slaps you across your fat ass, with a fat dick



When I met you last night baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for ya lady
But now I take it all back
Cause you gave me all your pussy
And ya even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give ya a call
Next time I'm feelin kinda horny
You can come on over, and I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck, that day, baby
Just lay back, and open your mouth
Cause I have never
met a girl
That I love
in the whole wide world



Well, if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfuckin indo to smoke
I gets loced and looney, bitch you can't Do Me
Do we like BBD, you hoochie groupie?
I have no love for hoes
That's somethin I learned in the pound
so how the fuck am I supposed
to pay this hoe, just to lay this hoe
I know the pussy's mines, I'ma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it, there's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
Cause she ain't nuthin but a bitch to me
And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me
i gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention
Approach it with a different proposition, I'm Kurupt
Hoe you'll never be my only one, trick ass beeeitch!



It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none



Guess who back in the motherfuckin house
With a fat dick for your motherfuckin mouth
Hoes recognize, niggaz do too
Cuz when bitches get skanless and pull a voodoo
What you gon do? You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that hoe
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowin damn well, I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see, it ain't no fun, if my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love em



Whoa!
Hey, now ya know, inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the btiches
Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, six-fo' Rad to be exact
With bitches on my side, and bitches on back
So back up bitch cuz i'm strugglin, so get
off your knees and then start jugglin
these motherfuckin nuts in your mouth
It's me, Warren G the nigga with the clout
Whoo!

Can we get a motherfuckin moment of silence, for the small chronic break?
A-hah, niggaz be brown-nosing these hoes and shit.
Takin bitches out to eat, and spendin money on these hoes, knowhatI'msayin?
I treat a bitch like 7-Up I never have I never well
I tell a bitch like this
Bitch, you without me is like Harry Melvin without Bluenotes
You'll never go platinum
Hey Daz, give me a light nigga

We'd like to welcome y'all to the fabulous Carolina West
I own this motherfucker and my name is Taa-Dow
Y'all niggaz know who I am y'all niggaz tearin up shit
But we got somethin old, and somethin new for y'all tongiht
Put your hands together for Snoop Doggy Dogg
The Dogg Pound, and the fabulous Dramatics



It's like everywhere I look, and everywhere I go
I'm hearin motherfuckers tryin to steal my flow
But it ain't no thang cause see my nigga Coolio
Put me up on the game when I step through the do'
Ya know, some of these niggaz is so deceptive
Usin my styles like a contraceptive
I hope ya get burnt, it seems ya havn't learnt
It's the nick nack patty wack, I still got the bigger sack
So put your gun away, run away, cuz i'm back (why?)
Hit em up, get em up, spit em up, now
Tell me what's goin on
It make me wanna holler, cuz my dollars come in ozones
Lone for the break-up, so take off your clothes
and quit tryin to spit at my motherfuckin hoes
Seakin of hoes, I'll get to the point
You think you got the bomb cuz I rolled you a joint
You'se a flea and i'm the big Dogg
I'll scratch you off my balls with my motherfuckin paws
Y'alls, niggaz, better recognize
And see where I'm comin from it's still East Side till I die
Why ask why? As the world keeps spinning to the D-O-Double-G-Y



It's a crazy mixed up world, it's a Doggy Dogg World
It's a Doggy Dogg World, it's a Doggy Dogg World
The Dogg's World



Well if you give me ten bitches then I'll fuck all ten
See my homey Snoop Doggy sippin juice and gin
Don't slip, I'm fo' to set trip, to get papers
Styles vary, packin flavor like Life Savors
Ain't that somethin, talk shit and I'm dumpin
I had your whole fuckin block bumpin
Don't sweat, but check the tecnique, I'm unique like China
Ya never find the bomb-a-rama then this Nigga behind ya
So peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm coming through
One-two, three, you can't see me
I'm a G like that strapped with hit hard tactics
A fuckin menace, usin hoes like tennis rackets
It's on again, it's on and poppin
All I see is green, so there ain't no stoppin
I wanna see some panties droppin
I'm comin from L.A., she used to chill with Dre up in Compton
(All I ever did was just use that hoe
Show her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows)
I'm dishin out blues, I'm upsetting like bad news
Cut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes
Kurupt, the name's often marked for catchin slugs
and I smoke weed for the fuck of it
Ruff and rugged shit, it's unexplanitory how I gets wicked
but it's manditory that I kick it
Check it, I'm runnin hoes in 94, now must I prove it
Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be stickin and movin
Prepare for a war, it's on, I'm head huntin
Hit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn
Peep, the massicre from a verbal assassin
Murderin with rhymes packin Tec-9's for some action
You really don't know, do you, you fuckin wit a hog
You can't do me, I'm goin out looney like O-Dog





Tha Dogg Pound rocks the party (all night long)
Tell when (till the early morn)
It don't stop (and uh) it don't quit (for the)
The Dogg Pound clique (to drop the cavvy Dogg shit)

Diggity Daz out of the motherfuckin cut once mo'
So grab a seat and grab your gin and juice and check out the flow
I flip flop and serve hoes with a fat dick
Till I die I'm still screamin that (bitches ain't shit)
Now i'm the mack daddy, had he, not known about

As you groove to the gangster shit
The D-O-Double-G the P-O-U-N-D, the gangsta clique
Now as the Pound break it down with the gangsta funk

But you know how that goes
We flow toe for toe, if you ain't on the Row
Fuck you and your hoe, really doe, so check it
It's Snoop Doggy Dogg on the solo tip
Still clockin grip, and really don't give a sheeit

And I'm still gonna fade em all
With the gangsta shit that keeps ya hangin
How many hoes in ninety-four will I be bangin?
Every single one, to get the job done
As I dip, skip, flip, right back to two one
Where the sun be shinin and I be ryhmin

So drop it on the one motherfucker put together that set
A nigga with a grip of that gangsta shit
With the Eastside hoes on my motherfuckin dick
And the Compton niggaz all about to set trip
Swing it back, bring it back, just like this
And if you with my shit, then blaze up another spliff
And keep the motherfuckin blunt in your pocket loc
Cuz Doggy Dogg is all about the zig zag smoke
See it's a West coast thing, where I'm from
And if you want some, get some, bad enough, take some
But watch the gun by my side
Because it represents me and the motherfuckin East Side
So bow down to the bow wow, cause bow wow

On a mission and I'm fishing for my DJ Warren G
Now I look for the bud sack

Cognac is the drink that's drank by G's
Sagging like a mothafucka, khakis to they knees

Collard greens, Indo and the cash flow
You know what I'm saying? Peace, G's up, hoes down


Pump Pump, Pump Pump, Pump Pump, Pump Pump
Pump Pump

Let the motion of your body be the key, cuz we
be the motherfuckin G Funk family
Now, I'll play the G in this deadly game
Snoop Dogg is the name Dogg Pound's the game
If it ain't one thing it's a motherfuckin nother
Word to my granny and my daddy, and my mother
Whether standin on the corner, or bouncin in the six-deuce
When I was locked up, I couldn't wait to get loose
Cuz back in the days, on the side where it's at
A nigga had to have a fat stack
And I was a fool, don't make me have to grab my strap and go
rat-tat-tat-tat, nigga slap to a motherfucker face he fall
Can't none of y'all niggaz see the Doggy Dogg
Cuz I'm one rude bwoy comin with the wickedness
So shut the fuck up, and listen while I'm kickin this



Blam blam, blam to dem all
Listen to the shots from my nigga Doggy Dogg (pump pump)



Now you can look to the Sun, and spot the moon
And see Snoop Doggy Dogg step into the room
With the G funk, he funk, she funk, we funk
Follow me, follow me, listen to the words that a nigga
I come down with the wickedness
One rude bwoy comin with the darkness (blam!)
Close your eyes cuz you can't see me
I quit school cause of recess you fuckin B.G.
I'm shakin up the party, like Lodi Dodi
Is he the dopest? Ya betta ask somebody
When, then, send, some gin
And a pack of zig zags now let the games begin
In nineteen-motherfuckin-ninety-three
I'm fuckin up every nigga known in the indistry
Check this out, it's a Dogg Pound thang
You know who I am you know my motherfuckin name, who am I?
(The S-N-Double-O-P) nickname (Silky Smell) last name (D-O-double-G)
The behavior and the flavor that I found
Makes me wanna hit that ass up with the Dogg Pound





Now just back up, don't act up, I pack up much heat
Any battle I'm in, I win, I can't be beat
Don't sleep while I creep peep out my technique
I forgot, I'm out of sight so you can't see the
MC of the year, you hear and you fear
i got somethin for them niggaz in the front and the rear
I handle the sides, did a driveby in the who-ride
I'm satisfied now everything is really alright
You know when I come nigga I come wicked
Don't need no permisison, motherfucker I'ma kick it
Niggaz sweat my shit I wet em up with the biscuit
Lick em up shot, it don't stop, till dem all drop
Make up your mind, go pop or slang rocks
Just stop, rottin on the next niggaz jock
I'm strapped with my glock on your block
And ready to let loose on the first imitator that I spot


I put down more hits than mafioso made
And Lucky Lucianno 'bout to sing soprano
And I know, I know the way you feel
And baby bubba we gon' keep it on tha real
Just to get you caught up in amazement
We puffin' on Cubans so it might get dangerous
But when it isn't, you can sit izzon bizzack
And let the Bizzow Wizzow ride the trizzack, ha ha
How you feelin'? I'm up to dealin', ridin' like a villan
Makin' a killin', thrillin' the crowd wit my new hairdo,
Outfits unused, fifty dollar socks, hundred-thousand dollar shoes
Man, I'm givin' blues to these sucka MC's
Who you be? You know who I be, young nigga
I'm Tha DoggFather


Snoop Doggy Dogg is Doggy Dogg Father (Father)


Let's make a move for this paper (Where we rollin' Dogg?)
We got's ta get paid (Makin' money all ya'll)
I mean I steps to tha stage in my G-boy stance
And say a few rhymes to make your girl wanna dance
I'm so fly like a dove
I come from up above
You trippin' on your girl cause she showed me love
Nigga don't beat em, cause if you beat em, you don't need em
You lay your hands on me, watch how fast I take your freedom
I delete em, but don't mistreat em
I stay up on em, and that's one ta grow on,
Let me flow on
You can rock to tha rythme you see
or you can rock to tha rythme of me
Just remember when you do your thang,
Make sure you do your thang on a hang
And everythang, is everythang
There ain't no mo' than this paper chase
Like them white-boy DA's was on tha case
You know I ain't tryin' ta floss, but uh,
(Murder, murder, murder) was the case that they lost
I'm Tha DoggFather



Now, do anybody in tha house remember
When there wasn't no Snoop Dogg? (Hell yeah!)
There wasn't no rappers hollin' 'bout LBC
Am I trippin' ya'll? (Hell no!)
Now, when I grow up, I wanna be like Snoop
Have prestigious women
That's the truth from the begining
In and out of the flyest hotels
You say your family don't know me
Hold on hommie, that's formost and promos
Sales, tails, scales and jails
Success before death
No one in my clique fails
As females with the almighty Father lead
Succeedin' ta give my peep's just what they need
And it ain't no party like this kind,
Cause you can leave your worries behizzind
But I'ma git back to tha grizzind
Snoop D-O double G comin' back for mizzine and
I'm tha DoggFather


Up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie
while you're bangin on ya baby OG's
That's why I flip the script to the boogie bang homey
If I'm hangin it's with DPG




Some do the things that they do cos they dumb
and some do the things that they do for crumbs
I do mine for me ya see?
Not the big homey double O-G
Scared to do your own work, man that's fast
and that's the reason why I had to shoot you down
because you never should've tried to work my Dogg
and the lil homey wouldn't had no reason to bump
Y'all know the game ain't the same no mo'
Lil G's keep heat so big G's freeze, geez!
Johnny Rockafella went to jail-er
few many times too many and became a teller
They sell a nigga dreams if he want em
but they won't sell you the game to get up on em
Ya tryin ta find em cos you want em, they shook out
Get the book out and when the pitch come, nigga look out
it ain't hard to pump up the lil homies nigga
but it's hard for your bitch ass to get wit us
But it's steel, you put it in their head
that at 13 they better off dead (now they gone)





Aiyo Snoop, why would niggas get into the bracket
and make a loot, niggas want trip
Spittin like "you spoke beef from the hood
Show me love nigga or don't show me shit"
Feel the fever, million dollar male like Cole Severs
Made a non-believin man into a believer
Receive a cheque the next day, my homies say
"it's the way to get paid", DP's and pay
I don't know why you wanna get on my back? (why?)
Trippin cos you know the bomb's at where I'm at
Well if that's the case you shoulda roll
wit the PG instead of losing control (motherfucker)
This is how we do, Dogg Pound Gangstas in blue
Me, D-A-Z, N-A-T-E and Snoop
Niggas from Seth be tryin to set you cos you settin your ways
so ask DJ Pooh what pays





Just what we need, bangin on wax another trip
What you gon' do nigga, jack the mothership?
You're like a actor wit another script
Predictable as Rambo wit another clip
How many niggas you gon' kill in your verse?
You need to sit down and learn to get down first
cos, uhh, real hoo-bangers are toast-slangers
not part-time FBI singers
Niggas havin bad intentions, sendin BG's on a mission
One move too many, nigga you missin
Listen you fuck wit the cyco-lic-no
loony ass nigga from your H-double-O-D
Niggas got too flossy from all the sex they tossin
but guess what it cost em, they crossin me
But before I give a nigga a nine
I'd rather give a nigga a mic and write him a rhyme


 Ai Dogg, let me holla at'cha man
 Wuz up home?
 Word is on the streets
Your beats gone be delicate since Dre did shake the spea's out,
man.
 Delicate? Beats?
So that's what makes me now?
Man, I don't give a fuck about no beat

(Now let me shake that shit man)
(I hear ya Dogg)
(It's a cold, cold thing!)
(It's a cold thing!)
(For real, hmm!)

I got more niggas tryin to get at me than the President do sometimes
Niggas be tryin to get at me cos I be droppin funky rhymes
What the fuck is goin on? This rap game is made to make money
You niggas is taking the shit outta hand, actin' way too funny
Doin too much, y'know I see it from the get-go
What the fuck's goin on wit you niggas, y'all tryin to play a low pro
And tryin ta be hard and tryin ta be big willies or whatever they call it
I guess it's time for me to act just like an alcoholic
And step to the game, I'm a stumble in like I don't know
And if a nigga say somethin wrong, I'm takin off from the get-go
I ain't givin no room to try to get me first
Cos I done been bombed on before and I'ma tell you, man, that's the worst
Fifth in the world, but I'ma keep my thang together
Cos I'ma keep makin money and hope everything is still together
Havin papers, man, now what y'all niggas doin?
All y'all broke on the corner, drinkin your drink, wanna be doin what I'm
doin
But don't get mad and don't be tryin to play-hate
Cos, uhh, takin trips around state to state
Representin, uhh, what y'all wanna represent
But y'all can't represent it cos y'all got no dollars, no cents
I'm movin on, groovin on and I'm movin
Makin more moves than the average Cuban
Tryin ta get G's across the town, tryin ta make more hits
And tryin ta get my game tight and get at your bitch
Now if she wants to get with this, she gone come holla at a player, do'
Cos she know that Snoop Dogg is got that white Rolls Royce
And she wants to jump in, bring a friend
Cos everything is like alphabet, come on in
Come on in and bring a friend and you can come on back
Cos when you do, we gone be sippin on some Cognac
It's on me, I'm feelin good tonight
Cos I'ma do mines and I'ma keep everything tight
I ain't lettin nothin leak cos if thangs leak, then I'm get caught
And I can't get caught cos you know how they do it about that child support
Shit, bitches is cold on a nigga who ain't got his game tight
Gettin 18-point-5 percent, half your life
Shit, I love my baby boy and all
But I ain't gonna be payin no bitch, no no, no way Dogg
I'm too slick on my toes, I'm too tight
I'm guaranteed to get away from some shit like dat, ain't that right
Cos, uhh, when you play in this game you got to be the real player
You can't be no fake ass nigga talkin about you wanna be the man
Cos if you ain't with the game, the game ain't gonna be wit you
And I can put that on everything including you



One of every five black males berfore the year 2000 will be detained or
deceased
No justice, no peace
Yeah the truth hurts, we scared to go to church

Look here, but don't cut it, gettin five points
Step back for a second, I'm puttin less than five to this joint
Hmm, if this is the bomb niggas gonna blow up like Atlanta at the Olympics
Niggas be trippin but I'll be pimpin
I don't be trippin off no nigga at all, no bitches
Just tryin to get money, I don't even be trippin off no switches
I used to like low-riders but now I like Eastsiders
I put it down wit me and make a hit maker, y'knowhatI'msayin?
I love the Lakers now cos now they got Shaq O'Neal
It's time to make a million dollars and that's for real
See we gone blow up and show up and throw up nuttin but Dogg Pound
Give it to ya ta put it down and we'll be round to your town
So just sit in your seats and wait til we come through
Until we do just keep smokin grey and blue
Or whatever you do just stay true to what you do
Cos we gone keep doin what the fuck we got to do
Now, follow me now and listen to the instructions
Cos the game's gonna get deep now, niggas is tryin ta creep
Tryin ta get up on game but they don't wanna be down with the PG
All of a sudden everybody wanna dis DP
Now, what we look like?
Makin y'all diss us, that ain't right
I should get upset but I'ma stay composed
Chill for a second, spit at some hos
Drinkin my drink, smokin my dank
Countin my bank, uhh that shit stank
Stanky bank is what I got cos I'ma keep it
And nah this ain't no motherfuckin secret



Yeah, we're in drought season
Niggas lookin for a reason
It's like thanksgiving without the feast
Yeah the truth hurts, we're scared to go to church

They got me runnin from my life, I'm jumpin gates
They got dogs on my ass, but I'm a Dogg
So I know how to alert and get wit dat shit
The dog run up on me I give him a cold
Like nigga back up off me
He turn around and bite the police, hmm
Game recognise Snoop Dogg too cold, I'm on my toes
I slide in the back of a garage, dippin with this ho
They run right past me, ask me "Have I seen the suspect?"
"Yeah, he went that way", now for the jack


Ain't no funk, it's funky, it's Doggystyle (Ain't it funky nuff?)
(Death Row-ow, Death Rowwwww)
(Everybody knows I got more bounce than an ounce)




Shucks, stompin in my big blue chucks
More bounce to the ounce while I'm ditchin you clutz
Bump-bump-bump-bump while you're bumpin your sounds
It's the zoo and the Pound we don't fuck around
Relax your mind and let your conscience be free
and get down, stompin grounds is the LBC
I slid up out the game and MC's get wacked
but now I'm back (Oh shit!), so go get your strap
Watch your head, I break wit
wit G's, Muslims, hardheads and dreds
Bounce, rock while rollerskatin
on them 20 inch tyres wit the platinum Daytons
I'm not that BG poppin all that junk
about "I'll fuck you up", he sound like a punk
I been there and done that, no inspiration
All day illustration beat conversation





I keep niggas in the studio, word is bond
Been workin on ya new album for two years strong
and still can't come up with the right song
You know what they say:'Study long, study long'
All aboard the train so come along
cos we keep the glue stuff against the bone
It's alright ain't no room for wrong
Doggyland is the motherland, make yourself at home
I got money loads by the barrels
I even got a few fans that's crazy like DeNiro
I'm international money maker, player hater
shhok up off the sake of spendin dollars and I always holler
at a player though cos players know the real from the fake
You can put that on your toast, your coast and your state
I give you people what you like
What I look like in jail and can't get on the mic





Killin up crews, give em the real street blues
Have em slidin in their eelskins, groovin in their tennis shoes
Of course it don't stop bein a Westside ridah
Wit no tattoo that's how they got the clue
I lay conversation on wax and CD's
BG's and o-riginals, here come the mission
Makin biters ride the Pound for the rest of the season
Doggy DPG ya lil homey, uhh
I represent the LBC-ment
Windows tint, nigga that's the president
I hit you with a tune every blue moon
Collard on your plate so you can stuff it in your face
Nigga say your Grace before you touch your plate
It taste like it's laced but it ain't
This one puff uncut, no doubt
Everybody know I gotta ounce and a half





Shucks
(Oooh ooh ooohhh oooohhhh ooh, oooh oooh oooohhhh ooh)
(Death Rowwww, Death Rowwww)



Josey Wales was known for robbin trains and things
layin everybody down for diamond rings and chains
It remains the same in the year you live in, see
Cos if I pull out some heat, nigga, you'll go kick in
And that's just the rules set by the fool from the ol' school
When it's time to duel, you get two men
Two heaters, one street, one clock
and when it strike twelve one of y'all gon' drop
If you're quick on the draw you're gon' see the morgue
but if you're too slow
I catch you on the downlow (Oh no)
Oh no, you mean The Kid, shit's real
I ain't no John Wayne, these niggas gangbang
The Four Horsemen, that's the click I'm wit
You mean the little bitty niggas with the itchy trigger fingers
Yeah, we're on a mission ta Kansas, slippin thru Texas
We stopped at Bonanza to get us some hot cakes
bacon and eggs, and then we slip in the whorehouse to get us some leg
Hop back on the horses, enforcers of courses
The niggas in black, the fearless Four Horsemen
Searchin for this location on the map
The gold rush, baby, got ta have it (I gots ta have it)
It feels just like it's 1865
and a trigger look-a-day is how I ride



On and on and on it's more strange
Time to heat, shootin range
Quick with the heat on their hip
Young Jesse James come to test your aim
I seen you at th e Wild Horny Corral
I hearda ya name
Tha forcify, nigga you ain't never lie
Besides I'm in the mood so at high noon we ride
From coast to coast, niggas mash on every stage coach
My disciples with rifles lethal in whole posts
The off-the-rocker roller coaster
On a six-shooter holster
with DPG on every Wanted poster
Let me think about which bank to gank
which fellow ta shoot and which teller to shank
I want all the shit you got in stacks
attached to this skirt in the corner
so I snatched the bitch in the back
The Dogg in me feels for the lust
but the hogg in me makes me wanna bust
Back to the drawin down board
Nowadays we drawn down more
To survive thru all the round wards
Battle up or saddle up and shake the scene
or get'cha pockets shaken, clean the slugs in ya spleen
I can't help it, I'm heartless, ya can't hack it
With my six-shooters on my hips and dusty jacket
Like that cock back
quick to pull my strap
Just to put the Horsemen on the map
(The gold rush)



Born is Doggystyle, individual, James got the hots
I got the six shots for all the plans and plots
I gots lots o' cash stashed in money bags
Worthy workers for all the Russian blabbermouths and gags
I got stacks so my stacks excell
Hop in the coach wit my twelve Clydesdales and bells
I'm on the move, smooth, to my decoy horse
A 30-30 on my side to shoot a nigga o' course
It ain't no stoppin young Josey
Box all the nosey
Headed to the saloon with my platoon where all the hos be
Left a dusty trail, bailed in swell
Gold spurs on the Gators, set back the clientele
Oh well, for the recop I drop my bet
Divide between my homies and ride the sunset



Two sacks o' money from the train heist
They ain't even counted it up
just mounted it up
Rode west toward the coaster, six-shooters in the holster
Pass thru a run-down town whose walls hold my poster
Closer I get ta death which is every second makes me sweat
so I gotta have what I can get
Heard word about the gold rush and headed West
on my white horsey with three straps in my napsack
Giddy up, the next town I rode thru
I had to threaten to blow their city up
Undebts with Chief Black, caught five miles west
sell us some beads and hail us some weed
He offered me a toke
he didn't have a 20 he had they beads-pipe smoke
I almost choked
Break him for the get, right, I'm off into the sunset
tryin ta reach my destiny fast
It's these two bags o' cash
44's cocked I ain't makin no mo' stops
till I hit the spot, I made it twelve on the dot
I slid off my boots, counted my loot
Five minutes after the strike of midnight
I counted 200 Gs, I cocked my strap and slept tight
(At the gold rush, at the gold rush
at the gold rush, at the gold rush
at the, at the, at the)


The dog saw 'imthey teartheylooked liked they try to tear him off.
I said "Oh my God! They want to eat my husband



I was sittin at the pound about to eat dinner
Had a hard day at the studio, I was gettin thinner
My nigga Sparky-O was playin basketball
and my niggas in the backyard, y'all about to squab my Doggz
Dirty ???? gets CREAM, it's a good scheme
But you know it's all a part of the Corleone team
I squabbleFriday cos that's what I do
Dogg Pound for life nigga, uhh thought you knew
but you didn't, you think I'm kiddin nigga, my Doggz scrap
They get down for theirs, bring em right to the back
Hit the gate don't wait and ask the homey Nate
he gotta pit named Tiny mobbin behind him
Now they've got Michael Corleone
Oh, Kurupt he got Lonely the psycho assassin
He likes to smash on, uhh
and ain't no need to reach for heat cos you can't get your blast on
Doggz we keep em, busters we sweep em
and when it's time all my Doggz'll bite your momma
We leave you niggas on stuck in paws
And I'ma dedicate this one to my Doggz
Remember that pit, the one I had named Petey
Uhh, she got killed so I didn't need him
Uhh, it's like that, what about Sweetie?
He got killed too (damn) so I didn't need him
It's a cold thang but it's a cold game
but when you wit a Corleone name it's a cold thang
Cold name, cold game ya got ta get down
cos if you don't then you can't represent the Pound
Now it's like a sport
and if I get caught I'm right back in court
So I gots ta keep it on the DL and don't yeezell
but you know I gots tha pitbulls for seezell
So if you want one, get one, holla at'cha boy quick
cos I'ma be on the lookout for the sell-to-dem pigs
Ask my little homey Technique
I 'came Scarface, Corleone killers, baby boy OG
The homey Tray Deee I give him rock seat
but the rest of the pits they rollin wit me
We're layin low in the cut, holstered up in Chino
Scrappy-Du and the crew called the Gambinos
Ma bark and she'll spark up some shit real quick
Just last week y'know what? She bit the shit out of me
???? bitch is a trick, I had to get cold feet
to get the bitch up off me
and I can't tame her and I can't blame her
That's why I had to name her the top Dogg gamer
Man, it's a shame-uh nigga got love for y'all
but I got more love for my motherfuckin Doggz
It's just.



Me & my Doggz (sick em), me & my Doggz (sick em)
(Beware, beware) Me & my Doggz



Now when it comes to my Doggz they stay fly like geese
but as for me I'm Snoop Dogg I'm soopafly like Priest
I unleash my Doggz then I tilt my brim
I'm bout to trip off Locko cos he go taken my swim
I think cos my CREAMy low, get back to the pound
He gon' be itchin like hell to put the bite on the clown
and when you look with the frown he gon' get like 1-2
and ain't a damn thang that your ass can do
I think it's cos he lost his big homey Don Killer see
who ran the whole yard and gangbanged OP
and leave your ass red and yeah half-head
He's a damn fool, he'll jack you for pants leg
Don't beg you're dead, and don't dare show fear
Young gangsta fucked wit Scrappy and Red tore off his head
and all the kid do was cry like a bitch
His life was a pit and mine's in the shit



(Beware, beware)
(Sick em) It's just me & my Doggz
I keep my heat in my seat, my killers in my backyard
Just in case you niggas wanna fuck and try to act hard



.deadly serious in East Los Angeles and South Central where people
encounter stray dogs on a daily basis and often bare the scars to prove it)


I had this bitch locked on to me like she was way too clever
Man, Soopafly never ever ever
Fell for the do no and you know I'm
Too swift on my toes and the gifts of hoez
It's too much for me to be givin' to you
Uh, all I'm givin' is some dick in you
Now Sh????, I told the bitch to blaze the weed
Now she blazed it but that ain't all she blew
Hey, I got knocked off on the bar
And my room got knocked off in the car
Gave it to me until I reached my peak
Baby flip talkin' bout lovin' me in the week
I said that's too damn quick, and too damn fast
You've been givin' up too much damn cock and givin up too much ass
Nah nah nah you ain't gettin' me like that
Soopafly ain't even called the bitch back
Ever since she tripped, I went on one
Stepped in the club, Caught me a homerun
Baby was bad and all, she said gimme a call
I wanted to break that bitch like a law
Picked her up at the bus stop, she was soft and smooth
Talkin' bout what could pop out and hit the roof
Then she said somethin bout the cost
Man, that same bus stop is where
I dropped that bitch back the fuck off
You can't ride my bird
So I kicked that bitch to the curb
You best to believe
You ain't got no trick up your sleeve that can get with me

You thought you had my grip
But Soopafly never ever slips
You thought you had my cash
Till I turned around and whupped yo' ass
.like a pimp and that's for real


I came through in a zoot suit, pin stripe lookin' too cute
Tryin' to get my shoot on, so I'm a scoot on
Over to the next bitch, say her name is Texas
She fly but she wasn't the sexiest
She had a hoe with her named Bama, short for Alabama
A big bad mama-jamma, now look here
I like big bitches cause they large
And big bitches always take charge
Wanna grab a skinny nigga like Snoop Dogg
Cause you like it tall, go and work it baby doll
Now a great big girl got a hell of a grip to grab a hold of
Got alot of cash for a little love
All they wanna do is take you down to the mall
Floss a little dick and get a t-shirt that say miss Snoop Dogg
I don't see a god damn thang
That's stoppin you from buying me that god damn ring
It'd look nice on my finger, I'm a buy you a zinger
Cause you make me feel like a real hip-hop singer
Your homegirl, bring her cause I've been dying to meet her
You know I won't cheat her, don't mistreat her
She only get the dick, I'll never ever eat her
But I'll drop her ass cause you know I don't need her
It was fun while it lasted
You know what they say, big things come in small packages, baby

You thought you had my grip
But Snoop Dogg never ever slips
You thought you had my cash
Until I turned around and whupped your ass
.trick beyotch beyotch


I said beyyyotch, what are you smokin
A big fat dick comin' from east Oakland
There must be some kind of misunderstanding
Hit the parking lot, bitch I be standing by the Benz
You think a nigga rich, bitch
Gold diggin' tramps tryin' to get with this dick
For all the wrong reasons
Niggas ain't trippin' during pimp season
But you still jumped your fast ass in anyway
If any other nigga picked you up it'd be payday
I rolled to my house with the bitch
(What'd you do $hort) introduced her mouth to my dick
Glad to meet you, make yourself comfortable
You fuckin' with a dog, bitch you ain't fin' to come up, hoe
So you might as well enjoy the ride
And serve this nigga from the eastside
How much for the game that I'm sellin'
Ain't no tellin' like Jack told Helen
I know sex sells but I'm a tell you though
Couldn't spend on shit that ain't valuable
Fucked all night woke up the next mornin'
Told her I'm a pimp but the bitch kept on
Wantin' me to do somethin' for the time she spent
It's funny, cause now she can't find the rent money

You thought you had my grip
But Too $hort never ever slips
You thought you had my cash
Until I turned around and whupped your ass
.trick beyotch beyotch

I got family members, homeboys
Muthafuckaz I look out way before you.


Can you feel it, nothing can save ya
For this is the season of catching the vapors
Since I got time, what I'm gonna do
Tell ya how it's spreading throughout my crew
What you want on Nate Dogg
Who sings on my records, 'Never Leave Me Alone'
'Ain't No Fun', now check it
Back in the days before Nate Dogg would get it
He used to try to holler at this girl named Pam
The type of female wit fly Gucci gear
She wore a big turkish wole wit a weave in her hair
When they tried to kick it, she'd always fess
Talkin about baby please she wrought his service stress
Since he wasn't no type of big chronic dealer
The homie Nate Dogg didn't appeal to her
But now he wear boots that match with his suits
And push a Lexus Coupe that's extra cheap
And now she stop flautin and won't it speakin
Be comin round the Pound every single weekend
to get his beeper number she be beggin please
Dyin for the day to eat these

She caught the vapors
She caught the vapors

I got a little cousin that's kinda plain
He bring the heeb wit tha beep for the Dogg Pound gang
A mellow type of fellow best laid back
But back in the day he wasn't nuthin like that
I remember when he used to scrap every day
When my auntie would tell him he would never obey
He wore his khakis hangin down wit his starks untied
And a blue and grey cap that said the Eastside
Around my neighborhood tha people treated him bad
Said Daz was the worst thing his mom ever had
They said he grow up to be nuttin but a gangsta
Or be there in jail or some other shaker
But now he's grown up to be a surprise
D-A-Z got a hit record slangin world wide
Now the same people that didn't like him as a child
Bought the Dogg Food, Doggfather, and Doggystyle

They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

I got another homie from tha L-B-C
Known ta yall as D.J. Warren G
He cut grass trasform wit finesse
 and all that mess
I remember when we first started to rap
He tried to get this job at Calvin's record shop
He was in it to win it, but the boss front and said
Sorry Warren G but there's no help wanted
Now my homie Warren still tried
On and on and on til the like break of dawn
To work at tha V-I-P would be the link
But they looked right past him so my homie straight dip
Now for the year after Regulate
Warren G is havin papers so my homies write straight
He walked into the same record shop as before
And the boss be like Warren welcome to my store
Offerin him a job but nah he don't want it
Damn it feels good to see people love Warren
Cause I remember when at first they wasn't
Now guess what they call sessy bussin

the vapors
They caught vapors
I got to talk bout me now

Last subject of tha story is about Snoop Dogg
I had to work for mine to show I was a true hog
When I was a teenager I tried to be down
And since they wasn't tryin to hear me I made the Dogg Pound
I saw a crew on 2-1 street
and said, 'Can I be down champ?' They said
no, and treated me like a wet food stamp
after gettin rejected, I ain't runnin upset
I said, 'What's a Dogg do to?' Rhymes at rates
When I used to go to parties, they make me wait
What I have to get on the mic to set M-C straight
I ain't never love no hoe since I'm listenin to my music
They acted like I wanted to keep hangin with the juzi
But now things switched from West to East
Short Dogg do ya remember me from 21st street G?
'We used to see Daz, back in the day'
It happens all the time, so brother don't be amazed

You caught the vapors
You caught the vapors
You got the papers


She was just a groupie (She just a groupie)
She was just a groupie
She was just a groupie (All she wanted was Snoopy)
She was just a groupie (Just a groupie)
She was just a groupie
She was just a groupie (All she wanted just was Snoopy)
She was just a groupie (Yeah just a groupie)
She was just a groupie



Beeyatch! (Beeyatch!)
I come thru with the humps, I thump tha shit out'cha block
I'm on alert for the cops, be on alert for the cop
Spot us some hos, tooted my horn at the bitch
??? ever skaty, my team ya's the shit
Fifteen's humpin, dropped the top, she moaned
countin my dough, purchased a 50 of some bomb indo floss
In South Central I'm on my way to the East Side
We high, blazin like crazy, we don't know why
feelin good as fuck on a hot ass day
and it's a pujam right around the way
Niggas got hos but ladies in the world
they wanna play wit their minds like little girls
I twirled my fingers in the air
rubbed my fingers thru my hair
Red bones to black bones
dark bows to red bows
Skinny girls come a dime-a-dozen
but I play hos like plenty-leany cos I get greedy
It's all about game cos when the game
is hard to maintain for so long, man
From Long Beach, California, from Tulsa, Oklahoma
Tonight *?warnin the award is?* from Mississippi, I know ya
hold the key to unlock the door
From long clothes she rolls with gold thangs we ridin for sure
So tell me how much money can one playa make? (make)
and how much o' ya ass can one nigga break?
You're just a gigolo (you know)
To the heart you're just gigolo (you know)

I was off in Vallejo
pullin hos like Idaho potatoes
What am I to do when life as a G
bein from where I be, DPG
It's manifico
ran into this pretty ass skirt, Mexican-Puerto Rico
mixed with a sprinkle of black
So I'ma approach her like dat
and let her know where I ride and reside at
My zone the place that I call home
is the Wall from Philadelphia, the room
Picture me ay
entrepenuer with my nigga D-A
Rockin tours and we still young boys
They got bitches, they got some bomb ass niggas
She used ta put em on his bomb ass dick
She always talked some bomb ass shit
She used to blow some bomb ass dick





That's right
Someone's at my door, baby who could it be?
Someone wants to score and get laid by the D-O-double G
Hey girl, what's your name? Ya wanna go a couple rounds with me
I told her Nate Dogg is just the same but she kept screamin out Snoopy



What's up baby, my name is Warren
I'm down with the Pound
cos I get around
So let me scoop you, swoop you and take you
Gimme a chance and I'ma break you
down to the very last compound
with my homies from Tha Dogg Pound

Now you know and I know
Rule number one, you can't trust no ho
Now you can get caught up in the mix real fast
The ho gon' slip away and get away with all your cash
You got to stay upon your toes when it come to hos
I bust a brand new ho in every video
That's on the Pound and the Row when the wind blow
I pass a ho to my kinfolk
and then smoke
She say she was no groupie, coochie lookin juicy
She say she never ate a dick before but she gon' do me
Right before she do me, I blaze up a lupi
then turn on some Snoopy and, uhh, heat up jacuzzi
and later on I might just turn on a movie
so you can regroupie and redo me just for Snoopy





There's roaches and shit in this motherfucker in here
I forgot about this


All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all


It's structures to this game, it's instinct mixed with knowledge
I'm a player in the game and I know not from college
Eyes open, focus, scopin out the scene
Watch the gangsta haters close cos they worse than dope fiends
I hope things get better for you
cos I'ma make things get better for me
and keep the Doggystyle hottest thing out the LB
The L-L-G wit DPG by the sea
We ride at high tide, the East is my side
I'ma tell you 'long as my voice is recordable
That plan you got ain't gonna work you better audible
Oh yes I'm fresh and like spy from existence
Wit persistence I perceive
to supply you wit what you need, no room for greed
Better go around and when it come to you
don't bite off more than you can chew
Respect the game and the game will respect you back
Game is life, life is struggle
without the coastal juggle
So if you drop I test that, fragile as a crsytal
(Will you get mad and go pull out your pistol?)
or will you be a man and pick up all the pieces
and put it back together and remain tougher than leather
As for me I'm tryin to keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all



Just keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all


Teatlet?, hold em, shake em, roll
Fly G boys and all you hoodrat girls
Pound puts it down all around the world
But let's pick up the litter, LB young nigga
I need solar on my Dogg nall, I bark when it get dark
Bitches in heat we tear the beat up, what?
On the microphone I bury the bone
Always, strays try to follow me home
Uhh, to get the pooper scooper, why? They droppin doo-doo
I'm steppin on shit, lift up the bottom of my shoe
See I'm smashin full-breaded wit no leash
When I mob, make marks across the street
See I'm vicious like hell, got em waggin they tail
for the bow-wow LBC style
Hit you like the Dogg bopper fever, I fetch paper
On the receiver, go get it like a retriever
I want em close enough so I can lock on em
wit the mizzic, see I let the Doggz loose on em
Check this out here man, I lick em, sick em
Man's bestfriend, I hit you for ten, uhh
Fleas can't seize my pack, what what's my name?
Major trick we're hittin licks like a doberman gang
Y'done trip and try to fuck me up ever since a young puppy
Run a cat up a tree, nigga it's DPG



All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all
Just keep it real Dogg


They say once upon a time in the land of the loccs
where it's all about dope and pistol smoke
I packs me a heavy calibre .38 revolver
We'd out, Dp'd out, GC'd out
Oh, did you not know
Snoop wit the .44 knockin at'cha door
We the passion for smashin and mashin the masses
Knockin niggas llike cash is, Dogg Pound Gangsta assassin
It's like in a action
cos for the cash in my own zone we known for blastin
Bustin, no need for discussion
We don't discuss, we stay close as 10 inches then bust
close enough to touch then rush
Clean and radical and get clutch
The Dogg is the Don like killer Corleone
for the D-O-double G (with the solid gold rhyme)



Just keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all




Yeah yeah yeah, make some motherfuckin noise
Yo Doggy Dogg you're on, live on stage
Performin tonight, excuse me Doggy Dogg you're on
YOU KNOW! The one and only
Don Corleone, the big homey y'know me

Well if it's on I guess it's bout time
Let me slide into this OG rhyme
I do mine the way I do mine
and I takes my time when I'm droppin my lines
I look around, I spot MC's (and they)
all in the place (and they) all wannabe's
Tryin ta make their paper, tryin to do their thang
but to me they all tryin to say the same thang
How could you rap over *?be said what?*
You ain't reachin the crowd, you ain't makin your fact
You ain't droppin lines that hit the top
You can't make the party go hip-hop
abd you can't do your thing without usin mine
We get and steal, I see you're on the grind
but I'ma take my time to get my point across
and if you get caught up in the rap shit then got lost
and if you get tossed it's on your own, it's your own fault
See I gots ta get mine, I don't try no song
I just move on, groove on, try to prove on
then I do mines to do mines and I'ma keep on, keep on, keep on
to get'cha you in asmooth type of atmosphere
Sit back and pay attention yeah
You ain't never heard it like that
Uhh, is that right? That's right black
but uhh,



Sixx minutes (sixx minutes), sixx minutes (sixx minutes)
Sixx minutes Doggy Dogg you're on
Uh uh on, uh uh on
Excuse me Doggy Dogg you're on


I gets my hair whipped on Friday, my day, why they

Gamey Gamey says "Snoop Corleone

It's niggas like that that get you caught up quick
You gots ta stay focussed Dogg, keep your eye on your grip
cos if you slip they gon' get'cha and they gon' get'cha fast
These niggas out for your money man, they tryin to get your cash"
I don't give a damn, you gots ta match
You can be from the East Coast and get love cos I ain't trippin on your ass
I don't smash on niggas who are smaller than me
I smash on niggas who big like the DPGC
Ooohwee, I get'cha crazy
You gots ta have a stomach for this shit, ba-by
And if ya don't you won't, you fake the funk
See Snoop is the G in the G-Funk
Now don't do nothin that you can't get out of me
Uh uh, you know I got big love for the real G's
We make mo' G's, I gots ta have it





I got the, I got the, I got the paper
I keep ya, I keep ya, I keep ya cryin
I thought ya, I thought ya knew my nigga
Ya better, ya better ask somebody (Better ask somebody)

Uh, it don't quit
Now let me take my time and just get into the shit
I'm just driftin, so swift and smooth
How many niggas make the whole party move like I do?
I can't name nobody
so sit back relax and let the Dogg rock the party
Ain't no party like a DP party
cos everybody in the DP party's naughty
They acts a fool, old school, new school
Everything is everything, everybody playin cool
Ain't no set trippin, everybody just dippin
Bitches gettin with niggas and niggas gettin bitches
It's all superb, word to my momma
Ain't no drama, no need for that
You can put your gat back in your pocket
unlock it cos Snoop Dogg is on the mic, I plan to rock it
Don't stop, (excuse me Doggy Dogg you're on)


Yeah man, this shit here gonna be bigger than the O.J. case

What?

His dick


Another blast from the Long Beach section
Break gangsta shit (Wake up)
I thought these fools knew



Out on the scout I'm about my papers
cos ain't nobody doin Deee no favors
I'm tryin ta get major with minor risk
Maximisin the minimum of time is spent
on the heist, nice and easy believe me
I take mine and make mine extra cheesy
Keepin niggas in a headlock
Undress em, press em down in a full nelson
I hit jacks off six packs of the crooked one
They slip and I'm bookin em
Fuck fingerprints, gimme from their fingertips
Chips to the neckline cos I got a Tek9
Check mine like a pimp-main ho
So hope you only see me when my grip ain't low
I go up in ya like a skeleton
So S-N-double O-Please let em know the crew I'm bailin with



East-side LBC
is what I claim but my game is DPG
And every hustler in my clique got to get his grip
and in my world a girl is considered a biiiiiitch
Is money all that makes you move?
You ain't doin what'cha s'posed to so you gots ta prove
somethin to the ones you love but you needs ta know
If you ain't doin it for yourself it don't matter d'ooooh!
It was a wake up, wake up, wake up..
Just to wake up, wake up, wake up.
Wake up, wake up wake up.
Get up, get up, get up



I break fools off like lepresy
If they dare, you stare when they next to me
I'ma threat to whoever sweat my style
Hard gangsta aim to represent til death
Reality, you battle me you be in the dirt quick
I'm clever with whatever type of weapon I work with
The bare hand man sleeper
I even banked up and shank motherfuckers in the penta?
I sanked a gang of tough fools in my time
so try me you're liable to lose on my line
The 44'll be what cracks ya head
cos that's exactly what I'm bout ta cap you with
I figured niggas gettin soft like jellatine
So Doggy Dogg tell em all who we're sailin wit



East-side LBC
is what I claim but my game is DPG
And every hustler in my clique got to get his grip
and in my world a girl is considered a biiiiiitch
Is money all that makes you move?
You ain't doin what'cha s'posed to so you gots ta prove
somethin to the ones you love but you needs ta know
If you ain't doin it for yourself it don't matter d'ooooh!
It was a wake up, wake up, wake up..
Just to wake up, wake up, wake up.
I had to wake up, wake up wake up.
Get up, get up, get up



Uh, gonna work that motherfucker and do the percolatin
cos Snoop Dogg came back with the head raider
Al Davis's? Nah nigga Tracy Davis
The Eastside Long Beach greatest
Criminal with style and boy you love that
Sit back relax and let me drop another rap
but this one's for the sisters and not the hoes
The ones who be groovin it on the step shows
Let a nigga in, I ain't diss ya friend
and like The Staples I make sure we do it again
But don't blow a nigga up or show a nigga up
and don't think a nigga sprung cos you know a nigga fuck
Love is a house and you got the key
so give it to a nigga like a D-O-double G
I'm from the



East-side LBC
is what I claim but my game is DPG
And every hustler in my clique got to get his grip
and in my world a girl is considered a biiiiiitch
Is money all that makes you move?
You ain't doin what'cha s'posed to so you gots ta prove
somethin to the ones you love but you needs ta know
If you ain't doin it for yourself it don't matter d'ooooh!
It was a wake up, wake up, wake up..
Just to wake up, wake up, wake up.
I had to get up, get up, get up
It was a wake up, wake up, wake up.


I think it's bout' time that we hit these n***as upside
the head with some of that west coast
gangsta' sh Ooh..Wee!!!!!!!!!!


It's a whole 'nother day
I'm back up in ya'
Snoop D-O-Double G
I representa'
Been away for a while but you all know
I'm still doggystylin' on Death Row
Got shit locked down
Sewed up
So If you plan on comin' out nigga hold up.
This a stick up
dick up
They got yo' shit on the shelf, oh mine is too
and guess who they gon' pick up?
Some niggas think they know they shit
But they don't
Some M-A's escape
Some won't
Bumpin' heads with niggas
Where you from?
East Side Long Beach, nigga, 2-1
The homie just got paroled
And he got more stories than the highway patrol
Tellin' me about the money Suge Knight stole
But I'll make that shit late
Cause nigga I get swole
Niggas tryin' to get in, to get out.
Put me up on game tellin' me who gon' jack me
But ever since
I was a puppy
till I was paroled
I never had no other dog pullin' on my chrome.


Say Snoop's upside yo' head,
say Snoop's upside yo' head.


Niggas in the game be doin' way too much
Akin' tough with this east-west coast stuff.
See Me
I'm all about my money mane
I stay fly and dry
I don't get caught up in the rain
Cuz game recognize game
No matter where you from
We all can get dumb, insane and
turn the party out
without a doubt
Unless
you them niggas who ain't got no clout
LBC and B what?
Uh, my crew
Cuz uh, we out there smokin' on the krazy glue
Upside yo' head like oops
Snoop's
The shit, that you hear them bumpin' in the hoops.
Can't afford it
homeboy
This is finished
I represented
From V-A to Venice
So when it's timid
And cold outside
Rely on the Doggy Dogg
To put the heat in yo' life




It takes a whole lot
to be number one
I can't walk down the street
without my gun
I can't trust these niggas fool
It ain't no fun
I'm sittin' up in court
Cuz somebody got dumped
What really counts is how the crowd bounce
Go home and say
Snoop rocked the parte`
Nobody got kilt
It's what got annouced
I guess they got a chance to see Dr. Bombay
But I keep my heat in case niggas get cold
Warm you up with the sheet
Zip you up and roll
Now Doggystyle records is now official
Gettin' money at the Pliz-ate with my initials
Shippin' weapons overseas
I'm makin' G's
What who you make call enemies
But I
See nothing funny about
makin' money
Cuz uh
We all know it don't grow on trees
So I
Gotta' get what I gotta' get when I can
Up homie in the mo'ning wit' the gat van
Burning rubber down to get a new car
So don't get jealous when you see me in the
double R.




Watch it!Watch it!
Daz is coming and there'll be no more waiting
Watch it!Watch it!
Kurupt is coming and there'll be no more waiting
Watch it!Watch it!
Doggystyle is coming and there'll be no more waiting
You might be shooting up close with the Itial ever lose respectin


Now follow me deep in the depths of my mind
Thinkin many plots blossoms how amny times?
I'm sedated my (?conscriptiated?) from beginning
Broke in the bombest weed smoke that will make a nigga choke
To my loccs way down in the Valley deep
To my homies in the Pound from L-ong Beach
To my bulls out in Philly coz all they smoke is phillies
Wit' these silly ass bitches out for a niggas riches
Now really really ever slip or trip
A big shout out to my niggas in ??
I spits the vocabulary to sinks MCs like ships
With my nocturnal rhymes and editorial clips
I gotta click that'll hit you like a thousand volts
The homies catchin cases,robberies and assaults
It ain't my fault that my shit might hit like that
Listen in,get elevated off the verbal contact


When a nigga gotta strive for his he can't stop
Gotta get somewhere
When a nigga gotta mash for his he can't stop
Gotta get somewhere


My mind-state these days make the average nigga afraid
Hurt em in the worst way,put it down for myself
Put em to rest,confess nevertheless
Snatch em a cap and destroy em at my best
For the simple fact that with contact we the block entourage
We drop bombs and we known to calm down the savage beast
And the rest of the jungle,while mistreat
Any MC tryin to fuck with D-A-Z
I represent it to the fullest,it could be a verbal massacre
In '96,with a diff'rent approach I'm shit
I got the flavour and I'm major,bust the ass
Niggas can't stop us and can't fade us
Shady ass niggas can't stand next to ya
When the Tek connects to ya,swift as a cheetah when I'm catchin ya
I bet'cha I won't let ya escape
Face-to-real on point-to-train-to kill beyond the violated area
When the smoke clears the area,rather we toast
So at home I blaze the zag or the bone
Once again another zone is gone
MCs try to step they get lit and blown

At the end the lights go out so before they do
I'm a L-B-C on through,stayin true
Demanding my respect,respect is what I've given
So respect is what I expect,the money got me driven
To the point of no return so the streets I roam
Don't catch chrome to the dome of this flack black
.45 calibre Glock,gat,gun or pistol
Whistle and watch all my homeboys come run
Or hear the click,damn that shit that you get hit with
When we bust I let loose,this is pre-meditated dick-up
To all the busters that jealous and hate it but can't fade it
With the every attempt they fail,oh well
Consequences get suffered,I put pressure on sucker motherfuckers
The bill is crisp,(the deal is )the deal is this-
I gotta plot em on a mash for my chips
Get in my way and get stepped on
I'm stompin,steppin with my projectile weapon

Wuz up (?Jex?)so's eject the hum
When I swarm through,who knew about the real deal I conceal?
But still can you feel the topic of the whole situation is trust
No ho is a must!If I bust
My brain constructs to form knowledge to the max
Defeatin and deletin elevation set backs
We wax tracks and smack up MCs who compose the violence
Bringin drama with no parental guidance
Eyes went deceived,somethin up my sleeve to intrigue
And these MCs will be Gs also D-P-Gs and L-B-Cs
When we do the do to you so go call your crew
And who wants to compete with technique
Conflict will be verbal so watch how you speak
And what you say when I display
Sleepless acts as (?bombin ya?),suffer from insomnia
And I'm a gonna be comin for you
So please be on the lookout for the Doggystyle Crew
(Watch out nigga!)


It's the sucker MC barbecue cookout!Cookout!
Watch out now!
Ha-ha yeah wit'cha bad self.Watch out!



Come and go with me to Doggylaaaaaaaaaaaaand!!
(Here ye, Here ye, Come one come all)
To a place that be, call it LBC
(I'm ridin' wit'cha baby)
Come and go with me to Doggylaaaaaaaaaaaaand!!
To a place that be, call it LBC


Now if you tired of the hard work
tears and sweat
and you breakin' your neck
and you still up in debt.
Walkin' round town all strapped in,
niggas be havin' more bad times than Captain Rat did.
Two strikes none left, out of breath
Livin' in the city it's a jungle yo.
All this deception on top of stress,
you havin' more problems than a algebra test.
You can't seem to come up, wit yo' money for rent,
and now yo' baby momma trippin' she want fifty percent.
It's a thin line, between yours and mine
the difference is you gotta scratch to a get nickel and dime.
Now I know a place where
Ya' might wanna be and I can take you there
Pop goes the nine, We'll go right behind
You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline.




Oh your homies think you're funny?
Doin' stick ups for moneys
Just to impress the honeys (This is for the honeys)
Got yo' rocks, so you keep'em in the sack,
you got two strikes, but you right back up to bat.
You all about yo' money and got something to sell
but if you bail for a robber you'll be back in the jail cell.
You chillin' wit yo' feet up
Someone hated but baby without the homies and
that's when you got beat up.
Because you can't be out there doin' low
and then right gather up yo' crew and roll.
Ain't no rules when you out there doin' dirt,
somebody's always layin' in the cut to get ya' hurt.
But see, I know a place where
you might wanna be
and I can take you there
Pop goes the nine, We'll go right behind
You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline.




Here ye, Here ye, come one, come all.
To a place that be, call it LBC.
(I'm ridin' wit' ya' baby)
Lemme holla to a little home boy real quick,
know what I'm sayin'?
Cuz he travelin' in the fast lane.

Stop the life it seem that we are on,
Time to slow your roll,
Let Doggyland be your new home,
Stop the life it seem that we are on,
time to slow your roll,
Let Doggyland be your new home.


Doggyland is the town where it's goin' diz-owne
(It's goin' down)
Everything is free,
and ain't no HIV. (What?)
And niggas don't kill one another
(Oh really why is that?)
Because a brother is a brother.
(And what about the mothers?)
They queens,
righteous,
man,
heaven must be like this,
green aroma like the grass in the summertime.
Ain't no peneteneries and ain't nobody doin' time.
And oh yeah, I'm the big O-K'er,
I'm smarter than the senator,
Bigger than the mayor.
Heaven on Earth
it's like a prayer.
And you can't get in without yo' gold card you got
to be a player.
Now you know a place where
You gots to be and I took you there,
Pop goes the nine, we'll go right behind
You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline.



Yeah
Vision 88 kilos of cocaine smack-dead in your face
The street value of that is what you dream to make
Run an illegal business,racketeerin
Smugglin,doin things from handin a gun,is what they fearin
Bodyguards and hitmen like some Al Capone shit
Heavy artillery got the cops on my dick
Different locations,spots where it takes place
If you show them my money,your ass is gettin f-laid
There's four major games that run the city of G's
The violators,the Gambinos and the Corleones and me
The violators and Gambinos they run uptown
Me and my cousin Corleone we run downtown
Murder's an everyday thang in the city
Where you gotta plot chips,jag robberies and do in its
Tanadian Nay,the charge of the weapons
Hit from verandahs and do a thing unexpected
So we plan a plot with an Uzi and 10 shot
Buck em till they all drop,circle round the block
Let em have it as soon as they come out
Unload on their ass,commence to takin them out!


Throughout the streets of Long Beach
The streets was infected with drugs,dope pealers and addicts
Gangs have taken over 75% of our town as the young
youth behaviour is outrageous with crime
They feel no remorse whatsoever, as the law enforcements
have tried to stop the trafficking of drugs
from coming into our country, but they can't
The murders have increased more than 95% and the drug amount
of which they make is more than 700 million dollars
Now wanted by the IRS and we will convict them of tax evasion


I had no choice or remorse for time for puttin it down
Niggas know the scoop is stupid if they come from my town
I been around since the Jumpstreet makin it pop
Young crook keepin hook,nigga,shakin the spot
Had to be a standout not to get ran out
Look for help,you help yourself cos there's no handout
Since the city Long Beach is only G's and hos
You hold on ya heat but them fiendish foes
Trust,bust,be aware and I ain't ya curse
Cos the niggas that I dared to (?agank?) the first
Think I might be deceased 'fore I reach my calling
As long as I'm haulin my heat I'm stallin
I bring it to ya hard from the streets of life
Where niggas get rewarded to grief for strikes
Don't speak on the creep,mo' fools is listenin
And war story glory ain't worth the riskin
Real niggas still get a mob like respect
If you represent ya set,till ya bite the deck
Who I be?I'm the Dee,nigga check the file
Under G you will see not to sweat my style
I'm takin em out!




I come through blastin,me as a Downtown Assassin
Mashin,may they rest in peace in they caskets
Shoot em down in front of Hassans
Should've known from the gate,who's the baddest?
In my zone,Don Corleone wanted
For the murder of forty men
Ordered to hit and watch him kill again and again
From the U-S-C,I shift ki's,a 120 plane rides
Multiplied by G's,87.3 million in a matter o'months
Big business and big dollars is all that I want
I blaze up to celebrate,new empire to make
Toast till we all die,till we burst and break
From knives to guns,from the rich to the slums
We ran outta dope,I don't think so son
While I be gunned by a mark from the enemy park
From daylight to reach dark and all the clucks a'spark
From when I pick em off like darts
Stab em in they hearts
Make an example,what I said,ya end up dead
Spayed the wall with graffiti like hogs for all my lost Doggs
Never reach until I see the blue sky till I die
All I ever want is to be left alone
Me myself,me my dope,me and my chrome
Got paid by cops and judges,I budge when I buzz
I got the City of Long Beach goin crazy for drugs



Slow down cause I can't take the heat, slow down
(Slow down baby, slow down baby)
It's wicked in these streets
Slow down, cause I can't take the heat, slow down
(Ohhhhhhhhh, slow down)
It's wicked in these streets


Life ain't nothing but a big old twist
A lot of times when I'm smoking
I'm doing that just to reminisce
It's funny, on how shit be
A lot of money, make y'all wanna come get me
But look here, I work hard for all the things I got
And to hang with a nigga's just an intricate plot
You smoke my weed, you try to bang my hoes
And talk bad about a nigga, behind closed doors
But look here dog, a hoe once told me loc
Bite the hand that feeds you, and you'll wind up broke
Bitch niggas don't deserve to kick it with rich niggas
Nigga we seven figure niggas
And we bigger than the biggest hip hop niggas in rap
And when we get to spittin' make sure y'all step back
You with that? Cause if you ain't clown,
We from the D-O double G, we groupie true, and slow down

Slow down (slow down now) cause I can't take the heat, slow down
(I can't take the heat, I can't take the heat)
It's wicked in these streets
Slow down, cause I can't take the heat, slow down
(Ohhhhhhhhhh, slow down)
It's wicked in these streets


Ayyo Snoop (I used to)
I used to cook up dope, ride with niggas
Know about the hits, hang with killas
Take the broads down for the jailhouse visits
Keep my bed warm with a cutthroat nigga
Have the card parties where the stakes was high
Go shopping hit the club and then ???
Never had a day without no drama
Half the OG's age, but they call me Mama
Had the ganja overstuffed in the hefty bag
Orange peels to kill the smell slanging with my dad
I never thought about my life I swear y'all, for real
Until my best friend Jill got killed and then I
Dropped to my knees and called to the Lord
Please change my ways cause I'm living too hard
And too foul, how I'm gon' raise a child
When I'm out here buck wild, damn, I had to slow down

Slow down (slow down), cause I can't take the heat, slow down
(Slow down baby)
It's wicked in these streets (Slow down baby)
Slow down, cause I can't take the heat, slow down
(Slow down, slow down)
It's wicked in these streets


Yeah, I slow my roll down to a pimp strut
And started putting all this game on records for my come up
From sun up to sun down, I'm trying to get my money
Hata's ain't gon' stop me cause hatas can't run me
It's funny when a bitch was livin' foul
Every body seemed glad, but now they ?????
Cause I'm flossing, boss ballin' guilt free
And Feds can't take shit from me, so slow down
Snoop:
I got niggas shot niggas drop niggas for fun
I ????? from these shoulders, I don't need no gun
But it's the nineties, and niggas don't bump by the end of the round
The clown bound to dump, young chump
You don't wanna get caught up in my mix
Cause I'm a soldier, blasting at the rollers, bitch
We don't neva eva, talk no shit
Unless we mack that shit up, nigga you get lit

Slow your roll tuck your heat and watch the hatas
Slow down (slow down), cause I can't take the heat, slow down
(I can't take the heat)
It's wicked in these streets (It's wicked in the street)
Slow down, (I can't take the heat no more) cause I can't take the heat
Slow down (I can't take it) it's wicked in these streets
Slow down (slow down) cause I can't take the heat
(Slow down) Slow down
Slow your roll tuck your heat and watch the hatas
Slow down slow down
Slow your roll tuck your heat and watch the hatas

Some of that Beats By the Pound flavor, you feel me (you heard me)
Get your ice, get your cups, Cus we about to get fucked up in here
Yah (yah), Straight up, Uhmm (uhmm), Yah (yah)

I'm still smokin', driftin', swifta than a mothafucka
Twisted off a cup of that 'ole ignat juice
Heated in the seat cup fulla drank
Beatin' up the block in the dark blue tank
Bullet proof vest on my chest for the cause
Diggin' in my draws for dem muthafuckin' laws
Harrassin' a nigga, blastin' a nigga
I ain't seen shit, so why you askin' nigga
To fucked up off that G-I and juice,
C-I get loose, nigga what chall wanna do
I got a crew, but I choose to roll solo
Especially on Sundays dippin' in my low-low
Convertable top, spot for the glock, I ain't fuckin' with the hen dogg
So toss out the soda pop.
Put my shit on three wheels for thrills
I hit a corner and make sure my drink don't spill, that's real


Rollin down the street, with heat
Drankin', ???, Sittin' on D's
Top rolled back so I can feel the breeze
Never slippin', I keep my eyes on my enemies

Now trip dis', I'm on Interstate 10 fuckin' with this Creole
She said she knows NINO, now stop me loc
Cup of that Gin and Juice, I blank a bitch out
Then turn the bitch out, look here
There ain't no need for you to be wastin' my time
See I picked you up, now I'm gunna stick you up, And dick you up!
Give you what you need, then bring you back down to reality
With that California weed, she seemed trouble at first
And then it got worse, cus now I got my hand up and down her mini-skirt
Twerkin' that shit while riddin' up the highway
Doin' it my way, hella highway, the fly way
Swervin' in another lane, tryin' to maintain
And baby girl steady takin' dick to the brain
Now it ain't no thing, cus she swallowed it up
Then she wanted to take a puff, I said "Look here bitch you've had
enough"

Nigga, let's keep it real
Keep your eyes on your enemies cause some niggas kill
And the bitches, they'll break ya
Keep your dick in your pants nigga, cause they'll play ya
Keep your dogs in the house
Trill niggas from the street (woof woof) know what I'm talkin bout
Never bite the hand that feeds you
Cause you never know when your dog might need you




Went from halves to wholes, from wood to marble floors
Fuckin with hoodrats to top notch hoes
In my Rolls with the sunroof top
I told you hoes that Snoop Dogg won't stop
Tick tock, we got shit locked (say what)
Goddamn it feel good to be sittin on top
So let's toast to the gin and juice and champaigne
Welcome to my world and Snoop is the name

Damn a nigga only got 20 dollars shit
Check this out


Nigga 20 dollars to my name
Deep in this dice game
I dust off my knees
I fucked off two g's
Nothing left to do, but buy some shells for my glock
Why? so I can rob every known dope spot
I'm having hard times, grit, and grind
Shit I'm tyring to get mine
Ain't nothing to lose plus I'm living on the frontline
It's a cold twist the way that shit goes
Gotta keep your hands on some motherfuckin' fetty yo
And keep a down bitch for when your money run out
And get you gun out
And shoot'em up till they come out
I'm blowing in the wind
It feels good my friend
Silkk brought the Gin & Juice and my nigga chipped in
I'm amongst killers with a dub in my pocket loc
A drug dealer at the same time i love to smoke
But if I wasn't in this rap game
Would a nigga Snoop Dogg have 20 dollars to his name


Now 20 dollars to my name in this game of drugs
And the only thing we now is gan bangers and thugs
If my yale don't sell how shall we proceed
Because we can't slang the urb, cause we smoke too much weed repeat


I got 19 dollars and 50 cents up in my pocket with what?
With this automatic rocket
Gotta have it to pop it,unlock it, and take me up a hostage
Let'em now this itch of my finger is worser than jock itch
Extended glock clips allow me to cop chips
Erasing cops tips and sisters that pop lip, stop this
Cold blooded killing for ??? this
Soda couldn't rock this
chop a shelf when i drop this
My ??? can't chop this
The hunger that I hold
Setting here wondering should I take it from his soul
See this here with a hole
Allowed that silencer to blow
And took motherfuckin' lives for less than twenty before


Now with this last 20 dollars I might buy me some douja
Because that weed from Magnolia still have a nigga sober
I seen my nigga nigga from way way back
Me and him used to jack and rock a rental cadillac
He sees my nick, he sees my grill, he says I'm flossin
He sees my wrist, he says damn nigga you flossin
And I'm bossin, and tossin'em up at the same time
So if you thinking about with me it'll be your death in ???
And why put your life in danger over 20 dollars, that's all I got
And my weed habit is so close to smoking powder it ain't worth being
shot




Now look, I'm fresh up out of jail it feels goo to be on the outside
I had 120 dollars, but i spent a 100 on my ride
Now the only thing I got left is 20 dollars to my name
Nigga want front me some motherfuckin' caine
I told him weed charge it 2 the game
Nigga now now I gotta be on some murder one shit
Some slum shit
Some out the projects dumb shit
some weed and blunt shit
Some I don't give a fuck shit, where it from shit
Some penitentiary solitary confinement never see no motherfuckin' sun
shit
Now I got 20 dollars to my motherfuckin' name, and I gotta get more
So I tell nigga hit the floor I'm about to pull a motherfuckin' kick
door
Now whether it's rapping, or jacking, kidnapping, or gun totting
Y'all call me down??? do get scared I ain't flipped till my guns smoking

Now sure sure sure your broke sure sure sure your having problems
Food stamps didn't come on time and the lights have been cut off
But look here


Here's a little something about a nigga like me
I never should have been let out the penitentiary
Snoop Dogg would like to say
That I'm a crazy motherfucker when I'm playing with my AK
Since I was a youth I smoked weed out
Now I'm that motherfucker y'all read about
Smoking you and your crew, taking a life or two
You dont like how I'm living well fuck you
This is my gang nigga No Limit
My nigga C will fuck you up in a minute

Everywhere we go they say "DAMN"

Homies all standing around just hanging
Some dope dealing some gang banging
We decide to roll a week deep
Seen a nigga on Dayton so we creep
Real slow, in you before you know
I had my double pointing at his window
He got scared and hit the gas
Right then I knew I had to smoke his ass
He kept rolling I jumped in the bucket
We couldn't catch him so I said fuck it
Then we headed right back to ????
Sweating all the bitches in the dazzy dukes
We couldn't no play from the ladies
With seven niggas in a Nav is you crazy
She was scared and it was showing
So we all said "FUCK YOU BITCH" and kept rolling
To the hood now we was 'fen to
Find something else to get into
Like some pussy or in fact
Getting rowdy, shit but we caught the rat pack
On a nigga cold nutting it off

Rest in peace khaki's creased
From the east side of Long Beach
Pouring out liquor, thinking about my homie

Claiming dogg pound
Took you on lollapalooza with a nigga
L0Dog you my nigga
If you don't get no bigger
Spanky Loco from the the dub, and Little Man from the I
Dear God why them good niggas have to die
I can't reminisce too long
Cause I'm in a war zone
If I sleep, slip, trip I might get blasted on
So I'm gone mash on home
but on the way I see some of my enemies
And they tripping on me
Cause I fuck with Master P
But I;m heated, so beat it
And another 87 case, I really don't need it
Proceeded, I ain't gone cry for the homie
Shit we gone celebrate
Cause we now the homeboy is in a safer and better place

I'm in Junior High with a C+ grade
At the end of the day I don't hit the arcade
I to school from my moms apartment
I got to tell these niggas everyday don't shit
Cause where I'm at if you soft you lost
And to stay on course, you got to roll with force
My homeboy Dogg is chilling in a Benz
In front of his building witht the rest of his friends
I give him a pound no I mean I shake his hand
He's the neighborhood drug dealer, my man
I go upstairs, I hug my mother
I kiss my sister and I punch my brother
I sit down on the bed to watch some t.v.
 Do my ears decieve me
No That's the fourth time this week
Four young brothers got shot in the street
The very next day while I'm off to class
My momma go to work cold bustin' her ass
My sisters cute but shes got no gear
I got three pair of pants and with my brother I share
So there in school I made a fool
With one and a half pair of pants, you aint cool
Cause there's no dollars for nothing else
I got beans, rice, and bread on my shelf
Now everyday I see my momma struggling
So now its time I got to do something
I look for work
I get dissed like a jerk
I do odd jobs
And come home like a slob
So here comes Dogg his gold is shivery
He gives me two hundred for a quick delivery
I do it once I do it twice
And now there's stake with the beans and rice
My mothers nervous but she knows the deal
My sisters gear now has sex appeal
My brothers my partner and were getting paper
And three months later the whole hood cought the vapors
My family's happy and everything is new
Now tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do


Doggz Gonna Get Ya


Ay yo yo Check this out Snoop
All these niggas always talking about
"They looove this" And niggas got looove for you
Or nigga I looove this ride or this chin around my neck nigga
You niggas dont know what the fuck love really mean
Nigga you cant buy love at no corner store nigga
Love aint got no price tag
Snoop I want you to kick this shit to them niggas


hmm
Money is flowing everything is fine
I bought my self and Uzi and my brother a nine
Business is booming everyhing is cool
I pull about a G a week, fuck school
A year passed by and I began to grow
Not in height but juice and cash flow
I kick up my feet to watch some t.v.
Cause now I got other people working for me
I got a 55" television you know
And every once in a while I hear "Just say no"
Or the other commercial I love
That's when they say this is you brain on drugs
I pick up the remote control and just turn
Cause with this bullshit I'm not concerned
Me and my brother bounced in the Benz
We driving around our territory again
I pull up at the light like a superstar
An automatic weapon cold sprayed my car
I hit the accellerater scared as shit
I drove one block to find my brother was hit
He wasnt dead but the blood was pouring
And all I could think about was Warren
Later I found it was Dogg and his crew
Now tell mw what the fuck am I suppose to do




Yeah so now you see what I'm talkin bout nigga
You see what that love shit do ya
This nigga said he had love nigga and this nigga done shot yo brother
So what the fuck you gone do now


My brother s out of it but I'm still in it
On top of that I'm in it to win it
I cant believe that Dogg would dis me
That faggot that punk he soft or sissy
I driving around with three of my guys
The war is on and I'm on the rise
We rolled right up to Dogg's favorite hang out
What's cracking Dogg and let the bullets stang out
Someone shot back so we took cover
And all i could about was my brother
Dogg jumped up and began to run
Bustin shots hopping to hit someone
So I just stopped and let off three shot
Two hit that nigga and one hit a cop
I threw down the gun and began to shout
"Ay y'all all lets break out got 'em dip out
Now as I left there goes the boys in blue
They pointin they guns at my four man crew
They shot down one, they shot down two
Now tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do




Ya see the moral of the story is this
Love is a motherfucka
And Doggs is a motherfucka
You mix the two up you bound to get some drama
Loves gonna get ya
Naw nigga Doggz gonna get ya you ever try to play me and thats real
Thats real

Yes, this is me, the bad, bad dolomite
And I'm ready to put me in the White House
Make me the President
I'm gonna move on my first act
I'm a, get me 2000 raggedy ass painters
To paint the muthafuckin' White House black
Dolomite for your president
I'ma legalize every muthafuckin' thing
Somebody ask me how do I stand on Marijuana
Very high baby, very high
How do I stand on prostitution
I don't stand on it, I lay on it
I'ma legalize sellin' pussy
Sell it, sell it, sell your pussy, girls
Pussy will sell, if pussy don't sell
Grits ain't gross and eggs ain't poultry
And Mona Lisa is a muthafuckin' man




Once upon a time, in the L.B.C.
On the Eastside, off of 2-1 Street
There lived a young man, Cinderfella's his name
To make it interesting it's me, peep game
I lived in a house with my cruel step-dad
And two step-brothers who treated me bad
I cooked, I cleaned, I scrubbed the floors
And I was like an errand boy runnin to the stores
My brothers, they used to boast and brag:
"We've got Fubu, and you've got rags!"
And even worse than that, to make me feel low
They gave me a skateboard, while they had low-lows
Girls used to say, "Snoop, you're so cute
But you gets no rap with that to' up khaki suit"
Welllll, one day, up the Avenue
There was a man, surrounded by the Dogg Pound crew
He said ah, "Hear ye! Hear ye! Come one, come all!
The princess is having a royal ball
If you can rap, also dress fresh
You might win a date with the sweet princess"
Well I, um, ran home when I heard the newsflash
I bust through the door, straight to my step-dad
I said, "Step-dad, may I?"
And before I could finish, "Hell no!", he replied (Cinderfella!)
My brothers were goin, they were gettin down
Even Pops was goin for a piece of the crown (Cinderfella!)
They flaunted, they haunted, they knew what I wanted
"We can and you can't," is what they taunted (nana-nana-nah-nah)
They all stood there, laughin in my face
And as they walked out they said, "Clean up this place!"

(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love

Well I shrugged, I hissed, they all tried to diss
And I'd get them back if I had one wish
Before I could make my thought a phrase
There appeared a man from a puff of haze
He said, "What's up, Dogg? My name is Herb
I'm your fairy Doggfather, you know it, word!
Now I've came here with the main purpose
Of granting you your fondest wish"
I said, "Herb, my man, just make me fresh
And I'm sure that I can handle, all the rest"
With a snap of his fingers sparks began to shoot
And I was jumpin in my body: a slick silk suit
On my feet was some white tube socks
And a fresh pair of Chucks from the Foot-lock
I showed him my sack, and don't you know
With a snap, the sack became some doe-doe
Once again his hands began to flow
Then he changed my skateboard into a six-fo' (damn!)
He checked me over, passed me the keys
And said, "One more thing before you leave
You must return before the stroke of twelve
Or you'll turn back into your old self"

(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love

I jumped in the low-low and went on my way
I got to the party 'bout ten, I'd say
It was after eleven when I rocked the mic
And by the time I left the stage, the people were hyped (well alright!)
The princess was starin, while holdin a drank
Reflected from her eyes was gold tank
She waved her hands like, "Hello! Hi!"
Then gave another gesture like, "Come here, guy!"
I left the stage, girls came in flocks
The bitch was swingin from the hard knocks
I heard a sound, not a tick nor tock
Gong! First bell before twelve o'clock
No time to waste, I broke out in haste
The princess followed in a futile chase
A quick steady pace is what I kept
Lost one of my Chucks on one of those steps
For the six-fo' I continued my stride
About this time I heard gong five
I was down the block when I heard gong eight
And the princess screamed out, "Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!"

(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love

I was almost home when my luck ran out
And there went my suit, my doe sack and clout
My fresh low-low, also went too
And there was no denyin that my night was through
The one All-Star, the freshest thing I sported
Jumped on my board, for home I skateboarded
Made it to my pad, no time at all
Went to my room, or better yet the far wall
Hid the shoe away, still feelin pleased
Then jumped in my cot to catch some Z's
Early the next mornin, when I awoke
I threw on me old slippers with me old housecoat
Slid into the front, my family stared at me
Sayin, "Wasn't that you? Nah, it couldn't be"
They kept askin me if I did my chores
My butt was saved by a knock at the door
"Who is it?", that's what my brothers barked
"The princess," this sweet voice remarked
She said she was lookin for a certain man
Who could bring her the shoe like the one in her hand
The family ran around with their heads in the air
Bringin her shoes from everywhere
She just shook her head, a nod of relief
And said, "No, that's not the one that I'm lookin' for, Chief"
I ran in the room and got my shoe
And said, "Is this the one you're referring to?"
Well she said, "Yes, and you're so cute
But where's your doe-doe and slick silk suit?"
I put on the shoe, then there came a flash of light
And I was wearin shit, from just last night
Looked out the window, saw the six-fo'
Yelled to my family, "I've GOT to go!"
We drove up the Avenue, the princess and I
And in back of me, I heard my family cry

(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)


Yeah, this shit right here sound like a love song
(she was in love)
A gangsta love song, you feel me? Check it out
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)

Yeah, gangsta, uh-huh!
Have you ever had a pretty, young saditty
Black female with chips, from the city?
Her momma got ends, and her daddy got ends
And she liked to give me ends when I'm out with my friends
Good girl - why do good girls like bad boys? (I don't know)
When I was a kid, growin up, I never had toys
And I think that she can figure that shit out (why?)
Cause everytime she came to pick a nigga up
Shit, she'd take a nigga out
Roll around town, ask the pound, they know, look
Baby was my thang, nah, she was my low-low
Bought my first Rol-o, and then we took a photo together
Man I hope this thang last forever
We been together six months, and we ain't argued yet
She lovin a nigga, steady buyin me shit
And don't say shit when I dip with my click
And understand, when I'm down and out
may need some help with some chips
Her mother approved of me, but her father he don't
He probably won't, shit Pops ain't no punk
Daddy's little girl be in a gangsta's world
Buyin me houseshoes and khaki blues, California curls
No matter what her father say, baby gon' see me
It's like a jungle sometimes, that makes me Wonder like Stevie
Believe me, when I say that baby was in love with a thug
In love with a thug



(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)
Daddy I'm in love with a gangsta
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)
Momma I'm in love with a gangsta


Mm.. I'm caught up in the middle and I don't know what to do
I caught eight months in the joint, behind my crew
That I gotta do and I'ma miss you Boo
But I'ma write you every night and call you on the phone too
Whatchu gon' do? "You know I'm gon' stay true
But I'ma go ahead to college like my father want me to"
Well um, off to my cell withcha body on my mind
And I'ma call you back tomorrow round the same time
I'm on the mainline, 9500 for short
On another phoneline, holla'n at my other hoe
This bitch ain't sayin SHIT, cause the bitch ain't SHIT
Old fat golddiggin-ass county check receivin BEOTCH
I bail up in the Day Room and get in a scrap
Niggaz watchin Soul Train and I wouldn't turn it back (man fuck y'all)
Never caught slippin, always on strap
And now I'm back in the hole with no motherfuckin getback
Sit back and contemplate, and think about baby
And hope she don't get caught up in the world that's so crazy
But while I'm up in Wayside, and she off in college
She gettin a little mo' than a schoolgirl knowledge
Cause gangsta-ass niggaz go to school nowadays
I tried to make you wait, but I can't change yo' ways
She fell in love with the local G
And now they both in the penetentiary, she didn't mention me


(Uncle Snoop Dogg.)
Yo' whassup, whassup.
(Could you read us a bedtime story?)
Alright, alright.
Ya'll get my ash tray, get my lighter.
I'm a read ya'll a gangsta bedtime story.
Come here, sit on my lap.
(Okay.)
Check it out.

Great scotts, it's hot today
He ran up out of bullets so I shot him in his chest
He fell to the floor with his hands in the air
His vision gettin blurry but you know I didn't care
Peck, peck, he tried to stay on deck
So I ran up on this nigga and I shot him in his neck
Shooting like a muthafuckin vietnam vet
Riding on this nigga disrepectin my set
No stranger to danger ain't no warning shots
On the hood gettin hot, anybody can drop
You better have a spot up in town my nigga
Cause please believe it, it can go down my nigga
Caught up in some traffic behind some hood rat
Grease strikes you out with no get back
Wishing for a steak eatin on a Kit Kat
And your bitch ain't shit the little homie hit that
Sit back and go see, take a trip up with me
Let's go get a stick nigga dip with me
We can ride on some niggas for nuthin at all
Even if we cool with 'em, fuck 'em let's go get 'em
LBC in this muthafucka cuz
I had to show these niggas what time it was
We got thugs, cons, drugs and guns
We claiming everything nigga, even dimes and doves
Have you ever slapped a bitch to mack your grip
Or better yet, strapped a clip
To a muthafuckin' nine millimeter for heater
And put the ride down out of G two seater
You need a nigga like me to get your game like that
Young nigga, you could get a smack for that
I'm that nigga who brought the afro back
And pat your back and then I turn around and snatch your sack
Before I came out niggas was wearing slack
I brought the curl back and the golf hat
The black poker sack and this skandelous raps
The one eight seven kidnaps and jacks
I brought snaps to the game nigga
Raps to the game nigga, I'm that big rap name nigga
S-N double O-P fa sho
I do my thang way cut throat on the downlow
Oh once upon a time in the LBC
There lived a OG from the DPG
And all the little kids looked up to him
All the women stayed true to him, police tried to do him
But couldn't do nothing to him cause he's like stainless steel
And all they hated on him because he was way to real
I don't know why but he's just so fly
But I gotta end this story by saying goodnight

Celebrate, grab a drink and put a blunt in the sky
Worldwide, nigga it's 1999
Shit out of control, sign of the times
I ain't had this much fun since '79
I was only eight then, hadn't been to the penn
Just a young nigga on the front of a swing
Playin football up in Powly High
Too young to ride but it's still Eastside
Homocides didn't happen much, niggas wasn't rappin much
It's 99 nigga, shit, I know you strappin up
Hell motherfuckin yeah, nigga wanna see the end
So next year we can do it all again
Same dogg channel, same dogg time
Only the strong will survive in 99
So much drama and dillusion, my conclusion is confusing
Drippin on my memories, twisted off my music
Tryin to make my people do things, oh yeah we do's it, we do's it
Here's my number baby girl don't you lose it
It's smoky in this motherfucker while we cruising
And Eastside niggas is the shadiest (shadiest)
But them Westside niggas is the craziest (craziest)
Summertime on the grind, baby let me shine, let me shine
Roll with this shit, I'm cold with this shit in my prime
Nigga done time and I never dropped a motherfucking dime
Be smart, fresh start is all you need
First thing first, cuz, stop smoking cess weed
You are what you smoke, nigga stop hating
That's why you broke and that's why we celebrating
But life's so hard on a G, that's what they all say
But somehow someway, better days ahead, Freddy's dead
And Betty said Eddie's a fed
Sweaty in bed with a nine to his head
And he fuckin with this hoodrat that he met up in dance
Betty gettin mad cause Eddie wanna share
But look at how you livin for a minute then compare
I love confetti, I always stay ready
Keep some killers by my side and some riders by the telli
I'm ready to do now, who now, you now
Eddie wasn't ready when they drew that, booyow
Two down, with just one gun
My nigga, and who said killin wasn't no fun
I sit alone in the zone with a face of stone
Live the life of Al Capone or Don Coroleone
Tragically casulties and fatalities
And all kinds of funny ass niggas coming after me
My grand pappy once sat me on his lap and he said
Sonny get your money 'fore you end up dead
I never really understood what he said
Until my motherfucking dogg took a slug in his head
Cold way nigga gotta learn his lesson
Slow down and go down, shit you know now

Be smart, fresh start is all you need
First things first cuz, stop smokin cess weed
You are what you smoke, my nigga stop hating
That's why you broke and that's why we celebrating
But life's so hard on a G, that's what they all say
But somehow someway, you got to make a better way

(Somehow someway)
You got to make a better way
(You got to make a better way)
You got to make a better way
(You got to make a better way)
You got to make a better way
(You got to make a better way)
You got to make a better way
(Yeah, better days ahead)
Better days ahead
(Better days ahead)
Better days ahead

That's real.
I feel your pain nigga.
I used to be just like you nigga.
Before I got off in this rap shit.
Shit, nigga did anything to get a dollar.
You know, but one thing I never did do.
I ain't never beg a nigga for nothing or ask a nigga for nothing.
I went out and got my own ya feel me?
So from me to you, man to man.
Better days ahead my nigga.
Shit, keep the faith and get your hustle on.
Cause I'm a get mine regardless.
Nigga wether I'm rapping or on the streets.
I gotta have it.

Hand my coat
And roll me some dope

Different strokes
For different folks
Oh, you like settin' niggas up and gettin' them locs
Oh, cute little bitch with a whole lot of heart
Shit gets thick when the light gets dark
She say she gots a lick for me

Worth about 200 Gs and 30 kis
Now check this out Dre
Now if I don't move
Then a nigga like me
Shit I don't lose
But you know me
Dogg I'm movin'
Ain't nothin' to it, but to get to groovin'

You've been waitin' on a nigga like me
What's that
To take that chance and rob your man and beat up the pussy
A victim of the circumstance
(what about)
That's the devil
They always wanna dance
See we go out with a bang (bang bang)
I'm tryin' to work this cold thing
And take this whole thing
I get the money everywhere that I go
I bust a bitch and take her money for sure
I get the money everywhere that I go
I bust a bitch and take her money for sure

Say he doin too much, yeah nigga you doin too much
And if that stuck-up bitch got the bar posted-up
She actin like that hair's hers but you know what's up
Say she doin too much, yeah baby you doin too much

I gave my kinfolk the keys to my Suburb
I told em "Hit the side and slide and get the herb"
But guess who's callin, Pipedream Patty
Made that nigga park my whoride beside the alley
Forget about that nigga though (fuck that nigga)
Fuck that nigga yo
But I can't forget about him cuz he taught me everything I know
Oh no Joe, walkin down the wrong lane
Tootin on that cocaine, fuckin wit that wrong thang
Niggas like that (what), get things like they want it (damn)
Then fake the funk, doggonnit
Now loc, look at this predicament
You smoked out and can't be trusted, I can't kick it wit
Niggas like you, used to be in my crew
Goddamn, they don't make niggas like they used to
I remember Marley Marl and the Juice Crew
That's probably why I keep a tight grip on my deuce-deuce

Now if you're doin for your family and you can't stand it
Cuz you know these mothafuckers tryin take advantage
Say they doin too much, yeah nigga you doin too much
And if your kinfolk broke and he smoke dope
And he need to catch a mothafuckin different stroke
Say he doin too much, yeah Joey you doin too much

We parlay, parlay everyday DPG style
We might throw a pool party every once in a while
Now in fact we gon' do one this weekend
Let's see how many hoes me and my nigga Rose can weed in
I believe in, sharin the cock
Also, I believe in comparin the cock
Look, don't knock a nigga like me (why?)
Cuz she love the way I just beat up the pussy
Not just knee deep, she was totally deep
When she went down on me
She blew a nigga socks off, got a nigga rocks off
Ooh wee, baby you's a freak
Put my homey up on game like a gangsta
But my homey fell in love and he banked her
Ain't that a trip? Now we in a twist
Back in the county wit the red ribbon on his wrist

Now when a nigga hit his girl and she don't hit back
And he get his third strike wit no get back
Say he doin too much, yeah homey you doin too much
And when the homey in the pen, doin a sin
And his girlfriend fuckin wit his best friend
Say she doin too much, hell yeah she doin too much

I'm livin up in the hills, wine sippin wit mills
I'm havin major type of paper, I ain't trippin off bills (still)
Show me some respect and accept my coolness
And don't mistake my kindness to mean I'm foolish
Use this as a warning, cuz I'm startin
To figure it's some niggas think I'm soft as Charmin
Pardon me, cuz I ain't mad when you get bent
But I hate when fools mistake me for U.S. ?spray?
Friends and family, gettin after me like repo
Eat, smoke, choke then want me to throw em a c-note
You doin too much when you clutchin on my touch-tone
Callin strays over nigga leadin months gone
Conversate for fo' hours, wastin mo' power
And only get to hit a cold shower
You fakin like you're makin more moves than Simpson
But frontin, pushin buttons, doin nuttin but sin

And when a nigga on yo' phone, runnin up yo' bill
Tryin to tell some hoodrat bitch how he feel
You know he doin too much, yeah nigga you doin too much
And when your baby momma cryin bout she need some milk
And you heard some other nigga did been at her tilt
You know she doin too much, yeah baby you doin too much
That's real

Bitches upset with me (why?) Cause they can't get no dick
I'ma be on top of the game whether I'm, broke or rich

Cause we're all a little strong
In the Beach, where the paper's long
But as for me
I only G when I'm buss'n rocks
Dogg Pound



Nigga, you know you gotta have heart
I told you niggas from the start
If I'm still in it, I'm in it for life
Always stay down and keep my motha fuckin' game tight
Cause ever since Elementary, or was it Pre-school Quik?
I was a motha fuckin' fool
I had to have papers it was routine
A young nigga on a mission for them collard greens
I, shake niggas
Break Niggas
Make niggas, shank theyselves
For fuckin with my wealth (nigga)
And it'll catch on
Cause if it don't, it's on
And, cuzz, I ain't even slippin' when I'm all alone
Sittin' back loungin' in the Chronic Zone
Clown me ya gone
Surround me, it's on
Get the money you're gone
My niggas' paper so long

So if you want me, get me, got me
Should have shot him
But now they call me Snoop Gotti
And that's all I LBC
Betta yet, that's all I DPGC

I'm blastin' at this nigga that was trippin'
O, knuckle head nigga, thought I was slippin'
But I wasn't slippin', I was on deck
I blast his ass, peck peck now his shirt's wet
Dead, gone, light's out
With no remorse, I had to take him out
I'm laughin' at this shit cause it was funny
Fuckin' with the dogg I take your life and your money
And then I dip to my spot (dip dip)
And set up shop with yo rocks (motha fucka)
And nobody gon' speak on the 8-7
Cause still, all doggs go to heaven




I'm freestylin'
C-stylin'
Snoop and Quik comin' through we fin' to take you to the island
Where the bitches and the bud come free
And everybody listen to the D-O double G
Hoes on my dick, niggas on my nuts
People be lovin' me because I drop cuts
That makes sense, it make big money
See Snoop is that nigga who don't hafta play funny
But I got yo honey, up under my wing
Cause she like the song that the bow-wow sing
I'll put her in a cling
I won't buy her a ring
But I'll put her on the hoe-stroll to make me some green
And even if she never even saw me befo'

This time you act like a nigga who just did a crime
You got your ass busted now you facing time
The money's in the pack, it's on the drivers side
But nigga you was with it so when you be quiet
Now you facin twenty all by yourself
The nigga you was with man he rich as hell

Schlitz Malt Liquor was the thing back then
My momma was my homey my daddy, and my best friend
Ask the Twinz, them my lil locos to the end
And Warren G and Nate Dogg, shit them my true friends

She taught me everythang, but she didn't charge a fee
She taught me everythang, except how to see a G
For the nine months you carried, I hope you bury me

I made you cry, you made me smile
I just wanna say I love you for life

And touch your brim to the side, that's only if you a player
And all the ladies in this motherfucker acting up
Don't hurt nobody when you back it up
Cuz we came here to have a good time
Me and my niggas in the sunshine (sunshine)
On 3 wheels with one 9 (ya know)
It's time to shine, the world is mine (the world is mine)

Never hesitate to pop a 9 (bah!)
And always come up with the proper line
Stick to the script bitch I'm hurtin shit (hurtin shit)
Let me show you motherfuckers what I'm workin with

And you aint got to smuggle the shit up over the border
Affordable, sportable, unbelievable, feasible, and reasonable

Cuz me and my loc, keep big leaves of smoke
Gallons of Hennesey and 16 liters of coke

The meters are broke, we put the V to the note

A truck on the side of us but who wanna follow
Bet a hundred dollars that they all wanna swallow
Doggy Doggfather

Thang on mine, bang on mine

It's off the limbo with Timbo, you motherfucking bimbo
So quit knocking at my window, you nympho
Maniac, bring it back, now shake it up
Put it on the table, now break it up
Give it to me, now put a lighter on the end of it
It really don't matter what you spent on it
As long as you're gettin what you paid for
That's what it's made for, ain't that what you stayed for?


Who's that dippin' in the Cadillac?
Snoop Dogg
Smoke till your eyes get cataracts
Snoop Dogg
Who got a girl laying on her back
Snoop Dogg
Millionaire, making that paper stack
Snoop Dogg


You play me and I'll play you
You pay me and I'll pay you
Hold on boo, you got the game all wrong
This ain't your thang, this my song
Move on, we in the club, at the Shark Bar
Valet my keys, and park my car
No snap shots, cause I might get popped
As I slide by security, giving 'em props
First thing I do, when I get in
Let me take you back to when I first slid in
Grab my gin and, get my woman, put my bib in, no bullshittin
We be sippin, in the corner
With smoke comin' from up under us like we sittin in the sauna
Burnin' up the charts, break a bitch off hard
Little mama don't you start

Tick tock, the ice on my watch
Slap me 'cross the face around 2 o'clock
But the party don't stop till we blow up
Now every little nigga wanna show up
Manuev'in to this, grooving to this
Dippin to this, flippin to this, trippin to this
Ain't no skippin to this, trust this
Bust this, it's too hot to touch this
He say, she say, I say no way
Don't need foreplay, OK, obey
Everything that I say
And every day'll be like a holiday
I put you in the front seat of my car
And roll you round town like a superstar
Recline your seat and turn up the beat
Number one with a bullet, rolling down the motherfucking backstreets

Yo, hold on hold on hold on hold on
Stop the cameras, stop the press stop the press
Now Bill, this yo' nigga, Snoop Dogg
Now answer me this - did you fuck that bitch or what?


That's actually, not the first time that question's been asked; but
since, I believe, and I think any person - reasonable person would
believe, that that is not covered, in the definition of sexual
relations I was given - ahh - I'm not going to answer it except to
refer to my statement. I had intimate, contact with her that was
inappropriate - I do not believe any of the contacts I had with
her violated the definition I was given; therefore I believe I
did not, do anything but testify truthfully on these matters.


What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie sometimes?
What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie..hie..
What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie sometimes?
What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie..hie..


Lies, lies, stories and alibis
Big Mac in the land of the small fries
Everyone lies and tries to get by
Some of us drink while most just get high


You tryin to cover up the holes in your sneakers
You need to put your motherfuckin face to the speakers (ba-bom, ba-bom)
And quit tryin to run from it (holla holla at me)
and c'mere, you big dummy (dumb ass nigga)
Don't you know you can't run from the Dizzogg
I'm down with (?)za, the long arm of the lizzaw
Y'all, niggaz know what's happening you turn your back again
and I'm bound to get it crack-a-lin I'm back again
And everybody happy for me - ain't that the truth?
That's a motherfuckin lie (fuck that fool)
Black folks stick together til we die, hmm
That'll be the day..




Liar, liar, pants on fire
Smoke so much dope they call me Snoopy Pryor (well God damn!)
Which way is up I'm tryin to get higher
I won't stop puffin til I re-tire
My bitches, my niggaz, they off the wire
They love-ly, they love me, call me Sire
Movie star bitches the ones you desire
Angela Bassett, Tyra, Mariah, the flyest, the flyer
See most bitches like fuckin with a rider
Slider, to the sider, invite her
to a gangsta, party, provider
with a lot of meat by-products (mm)
And beat the puddy-pot and got up
She licked the dick from the top to the bottom
(woo woo woo woo) (That's a bad bitch!)
Then she grabbed me by my nuts, and said "Hmm I got 'em!"







Ah what's the use of the truth

The shit to me is simple, it relies on credentials
We credible individuals, ahead of you we original
Better known as criminals, thuggin off on the stereo
Killin 'em on the radio, some of them wanna hate me though
Fuck 'em cause they can't see me doe and here we go again
The jealousy took me over success, just keep you slower
While, you get nothin, we keep gettin more
Pump pump the jam up, drop drop the top
Hit hit the switch and smash down the block
And oh yeah this Long Beach so you know when you see a nigga
And don't never get the wrong idea nigga
(Yeah, nigga what?) Holla at 'em

11:30, talkin' dirty to this little birdy
I'm trying to get mine early
I can't be seen with your girly
Continue to mash these hoes
I keep it crackin' like pistachios
I get the money first
With no rehearsal
Snoop D-O double G
Still controversial
Aahhh

Ay ay Snoop whattup? This your nigga Dre
Ay man I was thinkin I ain't said shit on your whole motherfuckin album
So check it out, put this on there:
All you motherfuckin haters out there, can suck my motherfuckin dick!
And we still smokin, what?!


For the nigga who be talkin loud and holdin his dick
Talkin shit, he better LAY LOW

Now she sick, she better LAY LOW
For the niggaz who be claimin my hood
and really ain't from my gang, better LAY LOW
I hope he don't be thinkin I'm just talkin
and I won't do a thing, really HOPE SO!


Hmm, lay low, nobody move until I say so
Limo tint rollin deep like the President
See I don't go to clubs, I never chase a bitch (beitch)
I'm here to bang that gangsta shit to the apocalypse
We call it stress, some of y'all call it chocolate
Return of the Top Dogg, and ain't no stoppin this
Whatever the case, I ain't tryin to catch it
Lay low, blow big dope, and slang records
Unseen but well heard, do not disturb
The only reason you alive cause I ain't sent the word
I flip, faster than birds, Snoop Dogg will emerge
from the smoke and go loc, you shouldn't provoke
I bring the worst from the L.B.C.
Smash motherfuckers thinkin they gon' smash on me
Snoop and Dre give a FUCK about what y'all say
From the "World's Most Dangerous Group" - N.W.A
Ay, ay


Our rise, it was no surprise
I always knew these fools would trip
Hatin, fakin, schemin on mine
and on the down low talkin shit
Best move cause I refuse to lose
no matter which damn road I choose
So lay low cause you might be bruised
Top story on the evening news
I ain't for games, so if you wanna play 'em lay low
Lay down on the floor
I'm in a rage, so if we gotta do this let me know
That's what I came fo'


Where that nigga who be talkin shit?
He don't come around no more because I fucked his bitch
I made her suck my dick, while I was squeezin the tits
Then I hit it from the back, gripped tight on them hips
She tried to make me cum, but I was tryin to take her home
Dropped you off and seen you fishin on your raggedy Brougham
Coulda thumped you and the dog (you little fag)
And don't sag too hard, you show everybody your thong


Booyaka booyaka, we bring it straight to ya
From 22's to Luger's the shit that shoot through ya
Who you motherfuckers think the Top Dogg bang with?
The same click he came with and made the game flip
Now niggaz grow they hair, hope they stayin act hard
That's even tho' yo' CEO talk shit get slapped hard
The backyard is where we get our scrap on
The black car drive by then you get capped on


Whassup pimpin? It's P and Snoop
With Dre on the beat, this ain't nuttin but loot
They call me Jackhammer for all the bread I got
but they call me Bill Clinton for all the head I got
I keeps it real-ah, cause I'm all about my scrilla
The ladies love me cause I'm a million dolla hitta
It's, No Limit til I D-I-E
C-P-3, or Richmond, Cali's where I be

In this times
Of hate and pain
We need a remedy
To help us through the rain

Mac Minista in defense of the honorable Snoop Dogg
The anti-player has filed and submitted an "alpha"-davit
in the Game Court. With trumped up charges against
my client Snoop Dogg, Tha Doggfather - for 227 counts
of flexing his G's, popping his P's
dotting his I's and crossing his T's.
The anti-player has filed and submitted an "alpha"-davit
in the Game Court. With trumped up charges against
my client Snoop Dogg, Tha Doggfather - for 357 counts
of verbal and reckless endangerment
from the million dollar mouthpiece;
and leaving these super-sap suckers,
discombobulated and confused and shook up, like a pair of dice.
The anti-player, has filed and submitted an "alpha"-davit
in the Game Court. Charging my client Snoop Dogg,
Tha Doggfather - for distributing and manufacturing game.
Crossing state and county lines, with the intent to pimp the system.
Now if you wanna judge Tha Doggfather,
bring him before 12 G's and open up his files
and you will see, that ever since Snoopy was a pup
his tail was straight up - ready to shake rattle and roll
and charge from a hoe to a henchman about his pension.
So all you jerks with them $11 words
comin out of your $2 mouth
about a multi-million dollar Crip
who's got the mind of a bid'ness man, the heart of a tyrant,
and the tongue of a mack - I said,
he's a five-star guerilla Crip, with bars and stars
while you suckers is lookin for stripes.
His game is as sharp as a mosquito's needle;
and with this in mind, I'm gonna ask the Game Court
to grant a motion, of 995 - grounds, of dismissal.

Carla, Darla, Charlene and Camina
Tereka and Erika, they love to take care of her
Real motherfucker from the DPG
Keesha, Resha, Tammy and Renesha
I appreciate the way y'all skate
when the clock hit eight
now April and Kate
Y'all be doin' too much
Running your mouths
Fucking shit up, you gotta get up
cause I done had enough
Getting sick and tired of the same stuff
You told Kamil and she told Karla
and she told April and now they all know
But I could give a fuck 'cause all y'all my hoes
So, all that confronting the real nigga on site
today is today, last night was last night
As I leaned with my hand on my balls
I had to really check these bitches and tell then like this dog




Nina do this and Tina do that
Sabrina, Sakina, nigga them all my hood rats
Back in the days when I was on the ??
At an early age man
I was on the ??
Non-stop, I beat it up and tell that bitch to get going
(They be like hot butter on a breakfast toast)
Hollarin' out, poppin' a collar out
And talkin' shit on the phone to me at my baby-moma's house
(who's she?) Look here bitch do you know who the fuck I am
You better read your motherfuckin' first telegram
you remind me of this bitch that used to work for me
Had to cut the bitch up 'cause she tried to get too close to me
And tried to confront me at a club one night
Fuckin' with her friend, a fake bitch (Is that right?)
But you know I had to stop and applause
And I put my hand on my balls and said ?? what's up dog




I got my own spot and I got my own keys
So can't no bitch talk shit to me
Like Kiki did me, bitch changed the locks
And kicked me up outta spot
I learned a lesson, I wasn't guessin' or stressin'
I got another bitch and she was at the convalescent home
She said she needed a companion
Shit I needed a chaperone plus a new home
Snap, crack, it's on
But in no time at all seems she fell in love
But i wasn't ready for that
Topcat had to scat
I hit her friend from the back
While she was at work workin'
I was jerkin' that skirt
And fucking with all her friends that was flirtin'
And when she found out she told me that that shit hurt (boo-hoo)
A week later she fell in love with my homeboy Kurt
Bitch you ain't shit but dirt for dirt (bitch!)




This is a sexy bitch

Keep it shaking, Cali keep it quaking
Cause the Ryders got me bringin home the bacon
Show me love, and it wasn't no mistakin
that I would dedicate this melody - fuck the hatin


I had to tell my girl to pack her shit
cause she slipped and dipped inside
I need a girl that's ready to ride
to keep the heater right by her side


Aiyyo, so what the deal Dogg, tell me, keep it real Dogg
Niggaz seem (?) to the brain, how you feel Dogg?
Nigga I'ma ride, set it up, let it spill Dogg
Anything you want, I can flip, got the skill Dogg


Baby girl you so so-phisticated
Finance related, you graduated
to the next level in the game, wearin my name
Bad little brickhouse, go and do that thang


Yo - niggaz surprised when they open they eyes
Thick in the thighs wasn't part of they plan
Not just his bitch, I'm like his main man
Act shifty - your resistance gone swiftly
Bitches mad at a nigga, askin why he kissed me
Stop whinin, just to cry and get the mackin daddy
I don't like it when the angry chick is actin crabby
That's why he bagged me
Ghetto jewel, never loud and trashy
No stressin over chicks - problem? Bet I solve it fastly




We gangbang on these niggaz like we 'posed to do
and I'll be damned if I let a bitch get close to you
We posted Boo - you, my, one and only
Quick to dump before the homies
Remember when that phony nigga ran up on me at the club?
You filled him up with slugs, that's what I call love
All that pushin and shovin, kissin and huggin
Thuggin, dig it, dug-in
I'm lovin every minute of it Boo
The way you stay true, and always kept your cool
You kept the heater right by your thigh
And when the shit got hectic you was ready to ride
You didn't run out, when I pulled the gun out
That's what I'm talkin bout, no doubt
Ruff Rydin, Eastsidin, to the realest y'know
D-O-double-Gizze, you know how we get busy


Aiyyo, how could I leave a real nigga? A real nigga's all I need
Fake bitches try to take my place, fall to they knees
Don't violate, see my man, he don't like no scrapes
And if I heard you was frontin I hope on the case
Wild one? Maybe, but I'ma protect my baby
Test me fool and by the end you gon' think I'm crazy
That's how I do for my Dogg, keep my (?) strong
Both sides relied on the shit, nigga sing the song




Yeah.. hahah, E-V-E! D-O-double-Gizze! Y'know!
Ruff Rydin, Eastsidin! Foe life, ahh! Yeah..
And you thought it'd never happen
Fuck the haters, bow wow!
Woof.. woof.. woof.. woof..

Whatever you do, bitch, will come back to you, bitch
Heeeeeeey, hey; heeeeeeey, hey
Heeeeeeeeeeeey, hey; heeeeeeey, hey


I was in love at times
I was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes
I was in love at times
I was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes
Now who would ever think that I wanted a home
Three kids and a wife, never be alone
A dog in the front yard and that picket fence
Havin somethin on the side? It didn't make sense

 I'm a family man sportin a weddin band


I heard them niggas on your pager didn't give a damn
I gave you eighty percent of all my trust in you
The other twenty was cool, cause we gon' make it through

 The homies said she got my mind blew in, blew in


I told that nigga like Chris Tucker,
"Don't worry about what the FUCK I be doin'"
We was makin chemistry, but who is he?
And how dis nigga know the deal about you and me?

 I fell to my knees and asked the girl "Why?"


She looked at my eyes with no reply
So I cried, I was in love at times
I was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes




I was in love at times
I was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes
I was in love at times
I was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes
I was in love at times
They say "Game Don't Wait" huh Warren G?
Well the game better wait for me
I'm spendin my time while I'm writin these rhymes
In the Hills for real, sippin wines, girl you'se a dime
Got me losin my mind
Well if lovin you is a crime
I'm down to do my time
Lock me up and throw away the key
I once told that "This was the way love was meant to be"
I see you with me forever
We can do things that you never, thought you coulda
Up out the hood-uh, is where I took you, never overlooked you
I can't believe that you shook to another spot
And left me cold, now I'm hot
I'm tryin to find you, what am I to do?
I gave you everything that you needed




Took it for granted, shit, I'm cool now
What goes around, comes around

 I was in love at times
 I was in love at times
 I was in love at times
 I was in love at times


You know what girl I mean..
I was in love with you and you did me like that
But you know what they say?
What goes around comes around


How could, how could, you do me wrong?
You be messin up my songs (my songs)
Now a nigga must move on (I gave you)
Gave love, and you just, straight played on me (on me)
Had a nigga sick for weeks (for weeks)
Now I must begin my streak (I was in love at times..)

I am Sir Dogg, DPG fuck and I hate water.
I never learned to swim.
AAAAH! PUT ME DOWN!!!! Let go of my leg!!!
I HATE WATER!!!! I CAN'T SWIM!!!! AAAAH!!!!!


Now matter where I go, you got'cha eyes on me,
And everybody sittin' around waitin' on me,
Show us how you do it Uncle Snoopy,
So fluid wit' your technique, y'all niggaz gon' respect me,
Man, I been doin' dis' shit before I even learned how to crawl though,
Gettin' interviewed by mothafuckaz like Geraldo,
And niggaz wanna know if I smoke Newports or Marlboros?
Man, I'm fuckin' wit' dat real shit, nigga can you feel dis'?
I make dat shit for the realest of millions,
While I'm wheelin' and dealin' and feelin the feelin',
Hmm and oh what a relief it is,
That Snoop is back in dis mothafucka handlin' his biz,
Takin' care of his kids and makin' hits, oh shit,
There it is again, you never know if your career might flop, fizz
So, stay on your toes and keep a pair wit'cha foes,
And keep a set of new hoes and floatin' and tie da bow,
Fuck these niggaz and peep out Whitey Ro (?),
Somebody told? Well then, somebody gettin' rolled on,
And that's usually how the scenario rolls on,
Baby girl said she wanna keep her clothes on,
She either fuckin' gettin' stole on or gotta stroll home,
Well number one, keep your hand on your gun,
And don't (don't) trust (trust) anyone (anyone, one, one..)

Ohh you can't trust nobody baby. you can't even trust your own Mama!!!
This is Snoopy Collins. trust no one. especially a bitch.
Or even a bitch-ass nigga. Yo Ha!!!!

T-R-U-S-T in me, I'm sexy but I'm pussy,
The homies in the hood call me Lil' Bo Peep,
And you da type a nigga I been dyin' ta meet,
So Snoopy, what'chu tryin' to do?
Now hold on lil' mama, ain't no reason for me to lie to you,
Now what I'm tryin' to do, and what I'm gon' do,
Is hit this bud, I got a wife at home,
Bitch I ain't lookin' for none, you might got kids for cuz, or down wit' bud
Pushin' them dubs, look here cuz,
Lemme tell you how it's gon' be
If I was broke loc, these bitches wouldn't want me
I'm tellin' you the good-god truth, you want proof?
Ask them hoes over there, "Y'all wanna fuck Snoop?" (yeah!)
We'll take the money and the game away,
I bet they won't say the same that day,
But it's okay, cuz I don't trip,
Cuz "Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks",
I thought I told you, bitch I'm a soulja,
East side, long beach, gang-bang roller,
From the solar, cuz this, is it,
Can ya dig it? (I can dig it!!!)
Jelly Roll pulled a rabbit out his hat,
I pull a strap out my mothafuckin' back (Aaah!), cuz I know it's like dat,
I'm in a meetin' wit' these white folks talkin' bread,
They want a contract on a nigga till' I'm dead,
If I don't sign they gon' turn me over to the feds,
They struck me out, now I'm pinch-hittin' for the Reds,
But I'm a Dodger blue, so I gotta keep it true,
I gotta home-run, nigga we long gone,
I'm realizin', justizin', visualizin',
Rip-ridin', put mines in,
Takin' this game to the next level,
Trustin' no one, especially them Red Devils,
Keep ya head level, hand on my get-up,
Stay on the red-up, pimpin' ain't easy, but there's a whole lot of fed-up,
And like I told you from the get-go, don't trust no one (no one, no one),
And like I told you from the getti, don't trust no one


OH NO!!! YOU DID IT AGAIN!!!! PUT ME DOWN!!!!
I HATE WATER, I CAN'T SWIM!!!! I NEVER LEARNED TO SWIM!!!!
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TRUSTED YOU!!!! I PUT ALL OF MY TRUST IN YOU!!!!
AND YOU TOOK ME TO THE WATER.. OH NO!!!!

Yo.. uh-huh
I'ma try somethin different on this right here
but I know y'all gon' feel it
cause I know y'all feel me
It's some real shit right here, y'knahmsayin?
I ain't never did it like this before
Check this out..


I'm the kind of G that everybody knows
But I'm so low-key, when it comes to hoes
I never break the rules and that's just how it goes
All my friends and foes - know that's just how it goes
I can flip the script but I chose not to this time
There's so much to say with so little time, but I like it
(Yes I like it)
I'm gon' dip dive socialize and get high
I wish my people had, other ways
I'm thankful, that a brother's paid (that a brother's paid)
But how can I be happy? My hair is still nappy
I miss my grandpappy
I wanna do right but the world is wrong
That's why I'm singin this song


I'm tryin to stack a dollar pop my collar while I'm singin my song
Y'all niggaz better leave me alone (I think you better leave me alone)
I think y'all betta leave me alone (I think you better leave me alone)
I'm tryin to stack a dollar pop my collar while I'm singin my song
You bitches better leave me alone (I think you better leave me alone)
I think y'all betta leave me alone (I think you better leave me alone)


There's so much goin on out there in the world today
All these - ladies, players, gangsters, and suckers
I get caught up sometimes, some of the people I hang with
they turn out to be snitches, bitches, yeah they switches
But you know like I know I can't stop doin, what I got to do
I'ma keep doin what I got to (I'ma keep doin) y'know!
Everywhere I go, the game is the same
People lookin at me want me to say somethin
want me to do somethin, but I don't know nuttin
If I ain't gettin paid, I can't drop no rhymes
I can't do nothin for you no mo', I ain't got that kinda time
and they know..




I try to be to myself, and try to stay.. away from the world
But the world just keeps runnin after me (runnin after me)
I try to shield myself away from all the wickedness
but somehow, the wickedness is in my circle - what am I to do?
I try to ask God to help me get through this
what am I to do to this? Just do this, let's do this
So I, continue to mash, day by day (day by day)
I continue to play, play by play
And I con-tinue to spit my manuscript (spit it)
and say what I want to say (say it)
And I do it to ya ev-ery-day




Leave me alone, I think you better leave me alone
Leave me alone, leave me alone - better leave me alone
If it don't pay you wrong, leave me alone
I think you better leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alonnnne, leave me alonnnne
If it don't pay you wrong..

What's up y'all? It's the Mean-ster Green-ster

Hmm, who that nigga that brought you that gangsta shit
befo' you motherfuckers was even ready for it?
Showed you how to tie a flag on your head
and represent your motherfuckin set 'til you're dead
Bust on the cops while I cuss the Feds
Roll a joint, in the bathtub gettin head
Put the G in the P, flipped the G to a ki
Put the West coast back on the map bay-bee
Check my styles, check my files
I've been gangbangin since I was a juvenile
They cut me loose in nine-deuce I swore to tell the whole truth
Keep it gangbang 100 proof
E'rybody say, "Ay Snoop" - did Death Row pay me?
Look here young loc, shit it's all to the gravy
I really can't trip off the past, on the real I had a blast
Tupac, rest in peace and God bless all my enemies


Rain-drops, falling on my head
Fuckin with them haters, messin with my bread
Talkin bout the raindrops, fallin on my head
Fuckin with them haters, sleepin in my bed


Ain't No Limit to this shit, ain't no gimmick
Master P good lookin out homeboy, salute my Lieutenant (at ease)
I'm in it knee deep and can't creep no more
I had to move down South on the low-low, fo' sho' doe
Dippin through the woods with Fiend, Magic, Pokey
Mystikal, V-90, C, Boz and P (ya heard me?)
Windows on tint, ridin like the President
It's evident, shit I'm doin good (yeah)
I moved out the hood like I should (say what?)
And then they had the nerve to call me Hollywood (nigga what?)
But I don't give a fuck, if I'm misunderstood
20 Crip don't slip, yeah it's all to the good
Yeah the homies got twist too, whatchu say?
Oh the homies might get me? They'll get you
Listen here, don't try it, and don't deny it
And don't pay 'em no mind Dogg, man I'm tryin




Just when you thought I was gone, I'm back on
Knick-knack-paddy-wack give the Dogg a home
with a gang of pitbulls, rottweilers and doberman pinschers
Bonafied killers
The illest, cap peelers, that you ever wanna meet
Straight up out the ghetto where they pack the heavy metal
I got my hand on the wheel, my foot on the gas pedal
I'm drivin DoggHouse to the next level (woof)
and buckin two shots at the devil
Run up on his ass, and blast, like a rebel
Turn up the treble cause I hit you with the bass
Remember my name and remember my face
Remember these words, and remember the taste
And remember, we all gotta leave this place
I'm tryin to stay focused, I'm the loc'est in the game
The Rap Prime Minister, "Mr. G Thang"


Rain-drops, fallin on my head
Fuckin with the wrong folks, messin with my spread
Talkin bout the raindrops, fallin on my head
Messin with my ba-by, who's sleepin in my bed

Over-dosage of ferocious, WestCoast in effect
Bang straight gangsta shit, so you know it's on deck

Suffer casualties, challenge me, I handle it quick
No talkin', C-Walkin', we chokin' the block off
Lettin' the glock off
And throwin' up DoggHouse


WestCoast niggas and we all in yo house
Gang bang niggas we gon' turn this bitch out

Yeah! it's about to get Crip'd out crazy
Blast on all you suckas with the throw away to daily
Don't you shoot that little mothafucka no mo'
That ain't what he said when he hit the chest went through his heart, came out his elbow
You shouldn't have been talkin' that shit bitch boy
Sayin' the wrong thing against the real McCoy
Didn't know I was a cold-blooded gangsta
If you ain't ridin' wit us fool, we'll catch ya lata


We exploded, reloaded and sewed it up
Sprayed shots to the crowed, like a loaded pump
Keep this mothafucka jumpin' 'til they close it up
Then we dippin' wit a sip and some hoes to fuck
Pour late, the hard way, ain't no bustas here
So explict you can only get it once a year
Eastsidaz, the ridaz, they change the game
And let you know from here go, we straight came to bang


Put me on a leash if you dare and I doubt you
Ever see someone here, who gave a fuck about you?
Niggas on the streets gon' keep talkin' shit about you
As long as you clap fool, it's bigger than 'bout too
Fuck wit fools, that ain't never paid us
And try to turn the homies into traitaz
Blue rags with blue balls, fo' all you hataz

I'm tired of that punk shit
Where niggaz claim to done, where they from and who run shit
I bang it to the tip-top
Can't stop, won't stop, droppin gangbang hit rocks
To the last drip-drop
To the, tick tock to the blocks niggaz rip glocks
I'm knowin that this shit hot
This your first introduction to this motherfuckin crip hop


It's time to research the documents and pull some files
and put it down with this gangsta style
Cause I be seein niggaz bein more aggressive now
after peace treaty meetings and the weapons down
Sport Chucks 'member once it was Nikes and sandals
To me it's unlikely that you're sheisty and skanless
To manage this dramaticness I call my rep
Every step stay on deck keepin bustaz in check
Certified murder guide through the streets of death
Where the sleep ya slip soon as ya weakness met
From that real killer deal get ya steal and mash
Niggaz have done did when the steel'll blast
Pockets filled with cash, fuck a Benz or Jag
Lookin rough in a bucket, tuckin tens and Macs
Dip roam, chip phones, flip (?) and clock
Lick shots and the cops and control your block
Keep it true with the crew from the old to new
Ride providin 'em with guidance like your 'sposed to do
Notice who, participatin all the activity
That's how we livin G, strictly killer tendencies
So death to all my enemies
And to the homies who rest in peace, a dub bag and Hennessy
These weak niggaz killin me
with their proclivity to even proclimate that they as real as me




Yeah nigga this crip, crip, crip
Talk shit and I'ma bust yo' lip
I'm gettin chips in the summer in a nine-six Hummer
in D.C., fuckin with a breezy, easy
See we see all we can see
G.R. we can G, the Eastside family
Coherent, cohesive, the co-pilot
On this Eastside shit cuz, I'm co-signin
On the East fuck peace we ridin violent
Fuck where you been it's all about where I been
Sirens, gunshots, flood glocks get popped
when they all try to knock knock knock
Who is it - visit the papers, the streets and the labels
We got the hottest shit burnin on the turntables
I won't deny ya, I'm a straight rider
and you don't wanna fuck with me (yeh yeh)




C.. R.. I.. P.. cause that's all we G
I'm from Rollin', 20, Gangsta Crip
and I'ma tell you how the shit gon' C (gon' C)
Now if I wasn't rappin motherfucker y'all be starvin
on my nuts without bucks like Marvin
You can't sleep, you can't eat, look who starvin
Written bill paid but still gotta be a slave
Flip your own money, make your own proper
Get yo' own heat, in case some niggaz try to stop ya
Be a boss hog about your money, float loc
And trust no one, anybody can get smoke smoked
like a fat-ass blunt, of that bomb shit
Have a babysitter set that ass up for chip Chips Ahoy!
Niggaz ran in with toys
If you didn't see 'em it's the Eastside boys
We be mobbin, like a motherfuckin cut
Dirty dealt, lil' sag, lil' jay, lil' Chuck
Two times, trey times on yo' motherfuckin ass
Keep it O.G. nigga, rewind and pass
It's just another day and forty dozen, niggaz strugglin
Is you hustlin, do you relate to drug smugglin?
If so, grab a nine and start to trip
But remember, don't let nobody punk you out yo' grip nigga


Dogg Pound groovin, Eastside is the greatest
and other guys can't fade us
cause we're the hardest in the town
(?) and duces, never could be faded
And all you suckers hate it
Ohh crip is goin down
And baby have no doubt, we gonna turn it out
And that's on Eastside L.B.C.
And we're the best, we rockin coast to coast
and we be blowin dope, and baby that's the shit
I'm talkin real shit to ya baby (that real crip shit)
Duces 'n trayz bangin (that real crip shit)
I'm talkin real shit to ya baby (that real crip shit)
Duces 'n trayz, bangin bangin bangin bangin (THAT CRIP!)


Oooh! Yeah, that Eastsider shit (Eastside Eastside)
What y'all know about this here (what what wha-wha-what?)
I'm (I'm) tal..king.. crip shit (talk to me, talk to me)
I'm.. tal..king.. crip shit
I'm talking crip shit to you baby
Eastside.. ahh! Eastside, Eastside
Ahh.. Eastside, Eastside!
Uhh, ahh.. Eastside, Eastside

Life is much mo' precious
Than you'll think
Like a game'll make yo chips sink
It's so hard
Hard to trust a smile and face
When niggas got intentions already taking yo place
Keep my head up and stand tall
If I stumble, then I'll fall
Will you pick me up at all?
Will you pick me up at all?
I'm a keep it gangsta till my end
Cause some people do pretend
And ain't too many of us that we can call friends
That we can call friends
Ohhhhhhh


Now all I gotta do is keep my head up
And walk a straight line when fake friends won't mind
But I'm kind-hearted
And don't like being stepped on
If I wasn't real, I wouldn't be in this position
Like that, dogg, I got a whole lot to say
I'm by myself with my rhymes when we kick it all day
Lil' Jay used to say I'd never be nobody
But you know what I never do?
Smoke it off like Gotti
Five million dollar hits puttin in saxophones
Tray Deee & Snoop, we sound good on this microphone
I never threaten nobody to make it happen
Let me show you how we eat a full meal off this rappin'
But if I had a chance to give it back
I'd give it to the ones who helped me do that
Do that, straight from the heart
Eastside till I die
We ain't no contract friends, we doggs for life


It's a trip how we Crip
Suppose the enemies still
With both sides ride causing plenty of tears
Insane's and 20's both from the same city
A bunch of down niggas and it ain't that many
Me, C, and the G can think back to the start
Homies chillin', getting high, shooting craps in the park
And having a heart
To get 'em up if it was beef
Head up like G's, take it out in the street
Hold ya own was the code that I growed to view
So I fucked with and stuck with a chosen few
But Snoop Dogg, you can call me, whatever the case
And homie that ain't nothing that the set could erase
You put me with the homie, Goldie, though we never had spoke
A Insane with a 20, now we hell of a close
And y'all kids, my kids, so we family now
Cause I could never see you doing bad without
And that's real


Life is much mo' precious
Than you'll think
Like a game'll make yo chips sink
It's so hard
Hard to trust a smile and face
When niggas got intentions already taking yo place
Keep my head up and stand tall
If I stumble, then I'll fall
Will you pick me up at all?
Will you pick me up at all?
I'm a keep it gangsta till my end
Cause some people do pretend
And ain't too many of us that we can call friends
That we can call friends

What up cuz? You know aint nothin different on mines
When I hit up motherfuckers with that look in my eyes
It's a statement that I'm makin and aint takin no backtalk
I'm blowin niggaz hats off as soon as my gat cough
The last thought you rappin niggaz should think
Is you can never get a scratch with Tray Deee on the beat
On the streets over beef you dont compete with uno - you know
The general a criminal do low
Admit cuz I'm wit it then I spit it and lit it
Niggaz timid in my vision I cause tension and thinkin
By my presence I'm a answer to society's hate
A true rider with the mind - I pushed him outta his way
Fools petty and they ready steady comin with bullshit
A full clip with jewell will hit like a mule kick
A sure hit is all I'm aiming for when I blast
Motherfuckers hit the deck once I go in the dash


Now is the time
This is the place
To bang back the khakis with the church fat lace
West is the coast, east is the side
Long Beach is the city where them gangstas ride
Money brings power, power brings respect
Disrespect the set I gotsta grab the tech
This is how it goes and thats how it's done
Eastside 2-1 in the land of the fun


Niggaz how ya figure that the game gon' wait
I came home straight from the pen to take your place
Aint no chase this paper comin soon as I post up
And watch the victom's clock and catch him choppin his dough up
Fuck the his host up stripped, gagged and roped up
Take the whole cut and he be sure negotiative
I'm ruthless I shoot crips and bloods alike
Thug for life - come and catch the slug tonight
Insane mental frame feel no shame or pitty
Since the game is shitty I gotsta bang the city
Trippin gangstas so I brang the terroristical heat
Grab strap jacket mack to reach the tinted to peep
This is the beach now any nigga got a rebuttal
Kobe eatin what he speakin once he cant get the muzzle
Struggle hard for my title and intend to hold it
You want it? Then all invitations open




I take seven old B's put 'em in the street
Then thats seven more busta's who claim they got heat
And then it takes seven more C's before I start to reach
Then thats 2-1 for the set now lets stretch out in the streets
Tray Deee never do it easy fool so dont expect it
Niggas get checked and they sets disrespected
No question I'm all you ever thought that you was
Till you ran across the boss and now you coughin up blood
Shoot first fools curse before they kick up dust
Clip gon' bust then they gonna have to pick loc up
All they talkin cause I'm chalkin whole districts off
Since this loss a purple nigga's piss me off
Conflict with my clique get your bitch ass touched
All my comrads bomb back it's as sick as fuck
2-1 till I'm done never run from the turf
Check the badge boy we mash on run get it even worse





{They say Tray Deee is a ragy baby - he's way too crazy}
{They say Tray Deee is a ragy baby - he's way too crazy}
{They say Tray Deee is a ragy baby - he's way too crazy}
{They say Tray Deee is a ragy baby - he's way too crazy}

Just yesterday I had to turn a bitch away
I got to many on my side - I got to many in my face
Come ride with me
Take you where the gangstas play
Often heard but seldom seen
Thats the way that its supposed to be
When you do see me
Mobbin wit a gangsta lean
Got a piece by my side
You can ride baby close your eyes girl


I'm so cool
Cool..cool..cool..cool..cool..cool..cool


It's me I'm back again
It's never gonna end
I know y'all heard it all before
I just gotta give ya more
Catch me rollin in the night
If I turn off my lights
The eastsidaz in the game
You hear my voice and know my name
You should bang this down on your block
All through your hood
Burnin treesburnin trees
Ladies let the music run right through you
Just like I'll do - Butch Cassidy




I'm so cool I that I sweat ice cubes when I'm heated up
Take this move, this groove and still G it up
Stroll so slow you swore my leg was broke
Pimpin hoes down south, back east to west coast
Im Tracy Dee but think of me as mr. freeze
Gangsta leanin on the scene on them twisted deez
Big ballin mad doggin like a gangsta ride
As I exit I step with my stacey shine
I'm so cool but motherfcukers know I'm a fool
Ten times outta ten catch me toaten the tool
Laid back or stay strapped for pay back
To think that I'm slippin then crippin from way back
Now let me break it down a notch
Smooth like I do when I pound the cock
We cold motherfuckas holdin down the block
Everybody knowin that tha dogg pound is hot
We so cool now


If everybody turn there radios on at twelve o'clock
We'll make the world pop


It's too good right now
Blunkey blunkey
Remmey remmey
Plenty gumbo
Snoop gimme some mo'
Swakin that like a damn fool
Acedemics stacey adams feelin way to cool
Theres alot things that make me wanna frown though
But I'm grinnin like a motherfucka
Throwin dogg pound up
Snappin my fingaz stompin my feet
It's what you get from a gangsta with these hard ass beats
I'm cool as fuck and don't say to much
Talk shit to the homies cuz they know whats up
As the gangstas go dead diggle my niggle
Still got patience still makin niggaz
I just wanna be myself
What I receive from the homies is help
We had a conversation today about who aint pitchin in
Keep suckas away that don't fit in
I'm so cool

1998, Dogghouse Records steps on the scene
Unlike any other record label, we plan to get green
And keep it clean, and stay oh so mean
So rough so tough, haha


What his here? This for them suckas
Nigga I came from a long line of playas
that ain't scared of NAR' ONE OF Y'ALL MOTHERFUCKERS!!
I see these niggas wanna see me catch a case and get struck out
But I'm laughin', 'bout to knock they ass the fuck out
Bitch quit actin' like a stuck up clown
That's why yo raggety-ass attitude is fucked up now
Suga Freeeeeehahaha
Bitch swingin' on my dick sayin WEEEEE!
The pimpin' is crackin' so I feel like mackin' tonight (aight)
Now them 70 niggas? 30 gon' hate us
That's why I play the role, keep control
and throw them off wit' these dirty gators
See time was torn
Cuz if I bought me somethin' to eat, shit
I bought you somethin too, WHAT'S MINE IS YOURS!
BUT NOW?! You'd rather bring me down and see me fall
Walkin' wit my head down straight dependin' on y'all


The call me Honcho
I like to Spark-le
I'm 'bout to barbecue a bitch like the charcoal
Am I a star? NO Ya' in my car? NO
My name is Soopafly, bitch so ya' all know
Now heffer don't act stupid, cuz y'know who I am
The nigga quick to talk shit and don't give a damn
I tell that hoe run, man that hoe better scram
I pimp across the land
Better read ya' motherfuckin' press telegram
Snoop Dogg told me that
Now blow me back while I'm pimpin on this funky track
Bang E.S. we givin' it up got the bitches singin' the rest
We blastin' motherfuckers, run up and come test
Better, hide yo chest and fasten yo vest
No bullshit, take yo bitches so quick and so fast (so fast)
Fuck wit' us I'll put a foot up yo ass


Collect calls from the pen, so I catch it in the kitchen
The homie say, send him naked pictures of bitches
And if they talkin' backwards, he'll have a homie's jackup
That nigga fucked Pat up, fuck havin' a homies tack up
We slap hoes that step on toes of our DaDa's
and ask them niggas in the Source Awards when I caught them
while y'all was pacin', the homies was bringin' up situations
Eliminating fake niggas while I'm paper chasin'




Dogghouse (woof) in ya mouth (we'll make you go away)



Yeah nigga, Dogghouse, this Kurupt bitch, yeah

OK, let the homies spray the K
Dippin hittin' switches bouncin' over ditches
Callicodes collapse niggas, perhaps niggas
Trap or dap and clap niggas, I'M YOUNG GOTTSTRA
Put it up, pistols might sizzle a nigga
For shizzle my nigga Kurizzle was nizzle my nigga
LIke a bitch or a busta, bust a, four fizzle
surface the air miss wit a homie, wait for the whistle
Who you thought we was? Temperatures might rise
Before everybody feel the fire from the 5's
I told Daz we about to fry niggas like fries
And seperate them by 5's, and light up the skies
Crip that D.P., K-U-R-U-P-T
Dippin' and I'm out, put a dick in yo mouth
Dogghouse gangstas (woof, woof, woof, woof)
Dippin' and I'm out, put a dick in yo mouth, ya bitch


Like this, for the sake of the game
Bitch nigga jaw-jackin' get ?blasted? out the frame
Let them punk punk you up
You jumped up and got stomped the fuck down, what now?
Showdown, got your three ring circus Bozo's
cannot work or see the tears of a clown
Listen nit wit, you can't get wit
try to sit wit, and get yo shit split quick
If you wanna say the word is bond
word is bond, then, I attack like ninja hunter
You rhyme soft like the other Hunter
Heather Hunter, fake a gangbang fronter
Capital D to the O-G-G
Capital H-O-U-S-E in ya mouth, oh bitch if ya didn't know
Long Beach City dirty like THE SOUTH!


?Wit Suga Free in? I'm in this motherfucker leanin'
I'm quick to do it umm, meant to do it
Stayed on my toes like the nigga pimpin', watching the corner
Much love to my niggas rippin', in California
Doin it big with my nigga Bad, these niggas mad
At the 2001 Benz, guzzlin' Henn
It's Dogghouse and we all in, ballin'
Goldie got a couple of hoes hoppin' out the Rolls, we chillin


I came in bangin dub ?minutes? (20 minutes)
All my niggas know I ain't no motherfucking gimp
I get down damn, runnin' from damn town
Dogghouse nigga, Dogg Pound bound
How you motherfuckers like me now when I do it like
Bust on the microphone, cuss on the microphone?
Yeah this nigga like Tracy, Tray Deee
Bang his ass, slap his ass in the striz-neet
Catch him wit the headlock, pistol whippin' wit the glock
Lil' Goldie Loc about to set up shop
These motherfuckers don't like me anyway
Shit, I ain't got nothing to say, wit no time to play
What these motherfuckers thought I was about?
When I bust this bitch i put my dick in her mouth
Now all them niggas got something to say
But I'ma tell 'em Lil' Goldie don't play, nigga


Yeah it's the genius of the click
Known to sleep a nigga quick
So watch how ya' gums bump speakin' on the wrist
I drew the diagram how to mash the game
Never hesitated when it came to blasting thangs
From the knuckle shoes buckle when we lock and strap
I'm a real rider nigga you can drop the act
I got stripes and bars from a life at war
Twice as hard, as niggas claim they sheisty y'all
Criminal, lay 'em down for their stacks and sacks
For the mic, used to trife with the mass and gats
Do or die, to survive from my time of birth
Then I'm out for gettin' mine till I ride the hearse
It's going down, Dogghouse gangsta style
And fuck Death Row, we'll take 'em out
We got the whole rap game bangin' now (C--RIP!!)
What you motherfuckers think this game's about?





Oh, good evening Topp Dogg I'm so glad you're here
All the bitches in the front, the gangsters in the rear
I'm not Dr. Jekyll nor Mr. Hyde
Whoever told you that, they told you a lie
You been a waitin' and a waitin', as I can see
So treat me like the pope and bow to your knees
Oh the genius on the mic is back again
So get on the phone and go tell a friend
I been a waitin' for a while as you all know
And now I'm back on the mic doggin' the show
I got platinum 'round my neck, that will never fade
The name of the chain's Mixmaster Spade
A sure shot, body rockin'
A c'mon everybody get ready to rock
A sure shot, body rockin'
A c'mon everybody..

Out the muthafuckin depths in New York, its P
You couldn't get close enough to even touch the kid
If you did,you wouldn't get far enough to bag
I put my guns to work on your bitch ass
Hold up, niggas fuckin up the game
Put my name in statements, cooperating wit these and talkin
Fuck it, I'll still buck em and gamble wit my freedom
These niggas gon learn to respect the P-Dub
I don't take no shit off of nobody
No nigga, no bitch, lets get rich and party
Lets not test my gangsta, thats how you get bodied
Thats how hearts get took, pride get damaged
Lives is shedded, fuckin wit these east side niggas
We teach y'all niggas bout this murder shit
We got Tray Deee, Goldie Loc, Hav and P
Kokane, wit my nigga Snoop D-O-G-G


Big hitters, wig splitters, give niggas the blues
Fools loud mouth we all about spittin them tools
From the coast of the locs were the Gs was born
And we raise up B.G.s to keep it goin
In the alleys, not the valleys, killa Cali the zone
Long Beach bringin heat takin off when its on
Fuck pretty, come gritty when we bring the noise
Big boys play wit keeps when we bring the toys
Wet T-shirts, we search to put in work, cuz
Come back for ya homies as you gettin ya dirt dug
Congregatin, operatin Gs and hustlas
You other muthafuckas can't concieve our structures
The DPGC, the M-O-B-B, stricly east side and we ride on G.P.
Bandanas, hoodies, timbos and chucks
Stay mashin on bustas not givin a fuck


Eastsidaz and Mobb Deep
We connected
From the West to the East
Connected
Oh what you got beef?
Connected
Run up on ya while ya sleep
Stay connected
My nephews play wit keeps
We connected
From the West to the East

Blast ya ass in the streets
We connected
Eastsidaz&Mobb Deep
Stay connected
For life

 Yeah




Connect wit my dogs be that serious shit
Serious things when M-O-B and sidaz bang
Ice and chains, be best that you hide those thangs
And pressure to that ass we apply those thangs
Told you fucks before, when it rains it pours
Its a cold ,cold, cold world nigga its Doggy Dogg
Better walk or crawl(for real), cause on the real homeboy
Fuck around and you'll be up in the morgue
Moms praisin the lords, rev paintin the picture
Of a wise young man who didn't get the picture
We keep it gangsta nigga, don't get it twisted nigga
Cross me nigga, you'll wind up a missin nigga
QB and we trully, rep for ours
Wars and scars, bitches in a gang of whips
When it came to this game though we changed the shit
And fuck who you wit, its what you up in the club but yo


Uzis, AKs, Glock 40s and Tech 9s
Tryna take mines, you'll be a dead muthafucka
Come up short, wit yo life on support
Burnin rubber down the street in a black super spoke
Fo' pokes to the neck, five sticks to the dome
Gun powder on my clothes when I smacked him in his nose
Real talk, show you how to walk the walk
All black all times when I scheme and stalk
Its somethin about bein a cold blooded killa
I'm bananas my nigga, like a black ass guerilla
I'm G'd up, smokin all the muthafuckin weed up
Drinkin on a full cup nigga




Yeah, defintely connected
How you love that?
Uh, like I said you can't spell the West wit out the ES
East side up eastsidaz
From QB to the LB
You see what I see and G how I G
Feel me?
Eastsidaz, duces and trayz the old fashioned way
Alchemist
Uh, yeah-yay

There's a scripture in the Mac Bible that says
'He that trusts a ho, shall surely be broke'
'Pressure busts a pipe that make water run uphill'
Alotta you niggas talk that shit
But half you niggas ain't real
Will the real niggas stand up and be counted
Or lay down and be mounted
Cuz this game is not a playground, it's a classroom
It's not a holiday, but an educational process
And experience is your greatest teacher
So listen to the gangsta mack preacher
Macks do what they want, bustas do the best that they can
From half of a gangstas start, is a sucka's dream
In the game God said, that he would send a G
With the street ethnics and G-Code
With the gangsta Ten Commandments
And the gangsta Ten Commandments shall read:
'Thou shall kill a snitch'
'Thou shall check a bitch'
'Thou shall charge a ho'
'Thou shall send a sucker'
'Thou shall respect the G'
'Thou shall pack that steel'
'Thou shall keep it real'
'Thou shall flex his G's'
'Thou shall stack his green'
'Thou shall stay true to his game'
See I'm a gangsta, not a prankster
I don't pull rabbits out of my hat
But I will pull a strap from behind my back
Now how 'bout that!

Pimp
Its pimp shit, its pimp shit
Nigga said his bitch took him to court for child support
Its cheaper to keep her
Cheaper to keep her
Thats real talk
Cheaper to keep her
Thats real talk, its cheaper to keep her


Now if you don't think I know what the fuck i'm talkin bout
(What you talkin bout?)
Run down to the Dogg House, and see fo' yo own two eyes
Bitches try to pull snake moves to get a piece of the pie


Its impossible, to stop a ho
So let her go, and get the dough
Lead the way, or step aside
Break a bitch till the day I die


Check me out, no doubt, I flip the game and re-route
I check her in wit Magic Man Juan, or Pimpin Ken
I just got back from Milwaukee, the All-Star game
Not the NBA nigga, i'm talkin real playa shit mayne
Macks, ballas, hustlas, and prostitutes
On the real my nig, you got to, got to get the loot
And if you got to shoot to get the loot
Then I guess you got to do what you gotta do
But know this, fa sho this, its somethin for realler
From a fifty cent nigga to a thousand dollar nigga
Fuck George Bush, the army, and the G.I.
Nigga this P.I., until I D.I.




Now don't get mad when you see me wit ya girlfriend
She ridin shot gun, smokin the damn thang again
Now say it ain't true
Baby you gank em and play em it ain't no ring on you
That ain't what I do, just because I spend time wit you
Don't really mean i'm lyin to you
You got to understand what this young pimp will say
Cause right about now, it ain't no time for play
Now watch me slap ya ass wit dicks, bitch
You was stricly dickly, why you turn clitly
Thats even better, now both of you bitches lick me
Then I sit back and watch y'all eat pussy
Kick off my feet and count my cheese
Snoop this ain't the XLF, this the P-I-M-P
Look, she think she burned out
Wait until I put her on the fast track and have her turned out
P.I!




Lil pretty skinny ass bitch, but she gotta monkey
I know she suck dicks cause her lips nice and puffy
But she got the wrong thought, kinda got me turned off
Must be why she sweatin me, the ectasy she gon off
For realler, ho don't know i'm bout that scrilla
I peel her like a sunkiss for comin wit that dumb shit(stupid bitch!)
I keeps the P.I., poppin fa sho
Other suckas tend to love em, we just cop em and blow
Hos come, hos go, hos runnin ya slow
So keep her foot up in her ass, unless a dick in her throat
Main grew bitch will go what I make ya do
And keep ya eyes on my Stacys while i'm lacin you
Ya like sex and shit, and gettin naked quick
Ya lil wreckless bitch, so gon and check them chips
And bring every penny back home and deck
And pull a couple of mo' hos you know that wanna get wrecked

Sticky fingers is the one I love
I love him, I love you


Mmm, mmm, mmm
Sometimes I just look at how you buy me things
Before I split you wide open and I take a whif
You so fine and now that you mind, it's that time
I'm holdin' on you close, can't wait to be kind
Slowly dig you out and spread you 'cross the sheet
Run my fingers through your hair, 'til you soft and sweet
As you clingin' to my fingers, time to get you hot
Wrap you up real tight, then I lick the top
Got you properly positioned to consume you whole
But I know as we together I'ma lose control
Any way I spark the flame and the games commence
As your aroma take over I get faded quick
See you fill me with a feeling so fulfilling it's thrillin'
That without you it's about to be a reason for livin'
I spend my last cash, even chose to fight
But yet I would even share if the mood is right
Let's get high


Sticky fingers is the one I love
I love him, I love you


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah


Sticky fingers is the one I love
I love him (I love you)

Yeah, yeah, yeah (You feel so good)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


Where my grinder at?
Where my grinder at?
So I can breakdown some Colombian black
Can't find my tire, so I use my 'tibs
Twist it up in some chocolate, now hit this shit
 And hold it in for about 20 seconds
Now how the hell you'd get "Mary Jane" naked?
Watch me light the cigarette up, I bet it burn out
Now hit some of this shit nigga, it get you turned out
Make you wanna jump back and kiss ya'self
Solo blunt to the neck, I don't need no help
But if I run to a bad bats, it's just anotha dollar loss
In time to pop my coller, 'til I pop a coller off
Situation sticky, no need for being picky
Don't touch ya face, the crystals make you itchy
Who's the theif that stole ya keef?
I had to smash on the teeth, right down the streets
You know why?


Sticky fingers is the one I love
I love him, I love you


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Even though I love you girl)

Yeah, baby, I'm just out here trying to get this money
I mean it's hard.. hustling late night
You know (late niight)
Some of these suckas out there tryna get what I got
Tryna pull me down (late night)
But you know.. I'm a real playa
Real hustler.. real gangsta
I'm bout getting this money (late night)
I don't give a fuck what time it is..
It can go down all night..


Button up the honcho, grab the brownies and heat
First step, to collect a nigga's bread and meat
The squares asleep
But all the hogs out on the prowl
Blocks get locked down like they off a child
Time to eat up off the streets full of fiends and hypes
Checking cream off ecstasy to the green and white
Dub sacks, the drugs packed up in kilo bricks
Getcha slang on, bang on, and keep yo chips
Baller had this, cause the savage beast did need to floss
So the hard, Bogard, and we squeezed it soft
Late night, the game tight, went up a notch or two
With fake vice, playin nice, steady watching you
Impossible, the clock when you.. ain't overtiming
The vivrant ways for crimes on the grind and start shining
9 to 5 is midnight to sunrising
Occupation gangsta committed to thug life


On a late night..
That's the time we gone ride
Nigga, it's do or die
Late night
We ain't checking for names
When the hollow points fly
On a late night..
Deeper and deeper
We had to get into some gangsta shit
Late night
Deeper and deeper
They don't know who they fucking wit


Dead bodies with a funky smell
Throw 'em in the ocean
Jack the fo' up two times
And young nigga, keep coastin'
Turn on the DVD and watch myself on TV
It's killings after killings but they don't know it's me
It's lil' G, now what you think that stand fo?
I'm gangsta on the streets and I keep it Crippin' in the studio
Who else be up late night ready to jack like the whole house?
Gallop in yo shit like the black joust
To make it real simple and quick
If I don't have it, I gots to take yo shit
And it's all about the fast lane, nigga
When you see me on the streets, I got my finger on tha trigga
Never catch who's slippin' when I'm on them 2-wing deez
And when I get my bricks, I flood ya whole city in titties
Please believe, that I'm a lil' crazy motherfucker
Turned out by the Spillman's, Gaithen's, and Ruckas


On a late night..
That's the time that we gone move a gang away
Late night
They call me Chef Boyardee, pushin' up some cakes
On a late night..
Deeper and deeper
I bang these streets for all so long
Late night
Deeper and deeper
Uh, wit this game that I got, I can't go wrong

Roll with me
Come smoke with me (Smoke with me)
Come close to me
So low (Come flow with me)
Dance with me
Take a chance with me (This is your chance)
Take a dip with me
Don't go


Oh no, I have a party to attend
With some civilized people, and some more of my friends
I wish I could stick around
But I gotta take a trip back uptown, now
Layin wit'chu, stayin wit'chu
Playin wit'chu, is somethin I ain't gone do
Now look here boo, there's so many freaks up in here
And I done already been there, so I don't really care
Now you can take that, take that
Bitch, I know you hate that, hate that
You can't do nothin about it
You know damn well what I got back at the house
And I refuse to loose, trade in my shoes
Gimme the blues, hand my the booze
Strap on the fools, overabuse or misuse it
So I'm skatin steady, datin on the move to groove
I ain't got nothin to prove infact, I got too much to lose
Girl, you got a nigga way ? and way too cool
But I ain't leavin here wit'chu, for real


Yo, this the single house
We gone disconnect the TV, leave the stereo and move the couch
Everybody get they groove on
I'm sweatin like a rainy day, but I get my groove on
Dip baby dip, fall back a little bit while I hold the hips
Pass me the drink, while you hit this G-13
Pocket holler one time, fashion statement clean
Stacy Adams supe it up, baby girl boot it up
Almost dropped my glass when she lift that damn booty up
Dog walk to the cat walk
I'm ridin that ass like Tony Hawk
There's somethin about the way you blow my mind
Got me wanna boogie all the time
Baby this is what I'm lovin
Forget the last dance just to end up huggin, let's dance


Lil' momma got a gang of ass
Plus that mini-skirt make me think she fast
Passed by and asked if she'd like to dance
Spark a conversation to ignite the flash
Bling bling all gleam, and I'm clean to whip
Saw the proper full crew I'm leavin with
You can act like the mack don't effect your type
Cuz you know a nigga tryin to have sex tonight
Ain't no secret, come freak with the real McCoy
Skip the guilt trip baby and just feel the joy
Make it rugged like you love it, never soft and sweet
Throw ya legs in the air and just start to beat
You can leave your thong on like it's all discrete
But it'll slide to the side when you fall asleep
Is you sho' that you can roll, dip, and smoke with me
Girl cuz I'ma give it to ya like it's 'sposed to be


Come fuck with me
Drink with me
Smoke with me
Yeah, yeah
Loc with me
Drink some Hennesey
Goldie Loc, and Tray Deee
Yeah, yeah


Yeah you tryin to fuck with a nigga huh
I can't even trip though
It might seem like, some shit like, two-two
Beep-beep, haha, two-two
Beep-beep, two-two

How else could you capture the world
if you don't attack from the back
To the million march hehehehe
(Yo, Snoopa Donna, what??)


When I pull up to the stoplight
I gotta have a paper right
If you come back right then we can boog it
When I pull up to the stoplight
I gotta have a paper right
If you come back right then we can boog it


Boggy, boggy, boogy
I'm going 65, 75, 80
Mashing down the boulevard downtown movin' like crazy
In the fastlane, high-beams shining
Tryna keep the timing on the track
With the diamond in the back
Move roof wide open, scoping, locking
The bitches relieve, the hoes keep hoping
They can get it, fit in, back seat, just sit in
Four hoes on a black tryna put their bid in
Girl, put it to work, you gonna do the damn thing
Happen, the rest of y'all, eat dirt
I'm rollin' in the "Mackmobile", I'm back for real
One hundred percent, pimp-motion, that's the deal
Back wheel-spinning, number one, I'm winning
Hoes lookin' inside, and they just to grinning
Waitin' to choose, while the rest wait to pay y'all dues
Don't trip I keep my hoes in two




Yeah, this is radio station 187.4 FM on your dial
In your car up inside the four o'clok traffic jam

Simple slim, man I'm large
Mashing so big like a fo' by fo'
Show my do', and if not it's hoe by go
Ain't a hoe after I can slow my flow
My wheels cause a fortune, bitch I'm scorching
Seen some niggas who love to talk shit
Reach for my thang and my glove compartment
Dipnap the use it, flashed in my music
Kids in the streets askin' Doggy how I dooze it
First place in the race and don't wanna lose it
Niggas better watch out and bitches better move it


Yeah baby, you got ta move your groove
To prove that you supposed to groove in the moon
as I recite naughty nothings in yo' eardrums
If you cruisin' up the boulevard in your car
Put it in park and let the dogg spark, yeah baby




Oh, no

And I hate Stoplight

Still going, black and white tip-toein'
Flash in my player's car (why you play so hard?) cause I'm a Don
Sippin Moet, smoking Chron'
Doggy wanna see that dress my locks are on
Pimping black-red, who let bag to blunt
Can't tell the sunset from the crack of dawn
Half tank of gas
Rollin' down the window, reach out to extinct that ass
Get hot, turn down the heat, burn down the street
My hoes love to earn my keep
It's only five miles left, so I whipped it
Skipped it, lifted it and overdrive
Straight onto five, pimp nigga on the rise

And I feel secure about this love romance

And call my name

Cause I believe in you

On your two way
But you ain't hollered back

In the world of change, here I am
Tryin to have some thangs
So what you need is some game, to get your money man
Ohh baby, in the world of paper, paper


Thinkin of a master plan
Cause ain't nuttin but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pockets, all my money is spent
So I dig deeper, but still comin up with lint
So I, start my mission, leave my residence
Thinkin how can I get some dead presidents
I need money, I used to see a stick-up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did
I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nuttin funny
Stop smilin, cause still don't nuttin move but the money
Cause now I've learned to earn cause I'm righteous
I feel great, so maybe I might just
Search fo' a 9 to 5, if I strive
Then maybe I'll stay alive
So I walk up the street, whistlin this
Feelin out of place cause man do I miss
A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of
Me and Warren G, and a big fat plate of
Chicken wings, cause that's my favorite thang
But without no money man that shit's a dream
Cause I don't like to dream about gettin paid
So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I've made
Soon as I bust 'em see if I got pull
I hit the DoggHouse, cause I'm paid in full




 Money, money, money, money!
 Money, money, money, money!
 Money, money, money!

A real slut, and let the ho get on and make her money

What she do, she jumped out of her sleep and left the pad at a quarter to two
That's on you, you shoulda put your foot in her ass, like a pimp's supposed to do
But instead of goin' 'upside da head'
You bought her a 5 karat wit your bread
And then she went and gave her homeboy Ted some head
I ain't tellin' on her, I'm just sayin', what you do
When your bitch out of bounds and you don't know what to do
What we do, we check 'em from the gate, to keep a bitch straight
It's on you, see you can take her out and buy her all types of things
You's a fool, cause when she leave you, for what he do
You'll see fool




Me and you, that's what you thought 'til your ass got caught
Shame on you, and now I understand why my momma used to tell me that
Ain't that true, you can't make a queen out a motherfuckin' hoodrat
Game on you, cause now you back at your momma house
And you sleepin' on tha copeasack
What's she do, I gave her the keys to my '74 Cadillac
Say it ain't true, she let a nigga drive it, ask tha homie Battlecat
Whatchu do, put my foot in her ass and mashed tha gas
You know me, and ever since that day my nigga, I've been P I M P

Shame on you (shame on you), your so in love you fittin' to get a tattoo

And call a timeout, before you put your dime out
Stop, pause, rewind before you put your rhyme out
And go to the "Wizard of Oz"
And tell 'em that your tryin' to get yourself a brand new heart
A brand new start
Cause you realized that you hadn't played your part
And that was smart
It's like a art the way I articulate
And break these bitches from state to state
See, I've been the flyest since I came out the gate
I ain't ask for it homie I just shake and bake
I won't fake to make you buy my tape
I say a prayer to the Lord just to keep my faith
Fuck straight

Though I bossed up, it ain't hard to tell that

All I had was a mic, a dream and some heart
Me and my moms wasn't getting along at this time

Judge about tired of a playa, I don't know about this bidness shit

World on my shoulder, but I can handle it
Now that I'm older, I'm sharper and colder
Can you remember when I slid in Deep Cover
And made niggas in the Beach love eachother
A street hustler, but I'm all set for the come up
Best kept secret so I'm want up
I've been acquitted up for 1-8-7
Yes I'm blessed thank God in Heaven
Now all I need is a push in the right direction
Weed and a mic now I'm writing checks
And now the game ain't stopping
And can't nobody say my name ain't popping
Started off young as a little-bitty buck
Now I'm ready for the world, and I got to give it up




You in the presence of a motherfucking millionaire
Stop, look, listen, feel, yeah I ain't tripping on shit

Fuck Cuzz, and him too cause all y'all suckas
Now with the savvy of a business man

And kept a spot on hot, West Coast on lock
Big Dizzel knocking down your block
Never looking back uh uh, a steady process
And leaving that way, cause see I'm blessed
It's like I'm happy now, cause I'm a family man
I fell in love with my kids and my wife again
And these here are the files of a classic
It's my throne till I choose to pass it
Worldwide and the sun shine so bright
That's why I wear my yellow C's at night nigga

This one right here is dedicated to a lot of famous players out there
That might have been in love before
I know some of you might not think gangstas fall in love (I miss that bitch)
But uh, it's true
If you been in love like I been in love before, you know
It's hard to get with somebody once they gone (I miss that bitch)
It's hard to replace that special someone
When they just up and you know
Dip dive and so socialize
And what we gon do right here (I miss that bitch)
We go'n kick something over this HiTek beat right here
For all the players that lost somebody special
And wonder where she at
E. White kick that shit (I miss that bitch)


I got my eyes wide open
The whole time I'm holding on to hope with you on my mind
It's been a while child, I'm getting down with Dogg
I bet my name all around your wall
Perhaps I went to jail
That left us out of touch
Shoulda shot some mail or something
Ain't no telling where she at now
I be God damn
Baby I really wanna see what you got now
I'm all grown up with my shit together
I don't know if I'mma see you ever
I got a woman and shit,but I must admit this
You at the top of my list
Unforgetable
Fuck with them nigga do
I still miss, there aint no getting rid of you
But in the mean time I'mma get with cha
Until I get somebody with your hook up Imma hit ya


I miss that bitch
She was a pot of gold
Her body was cold
I don't know where you went
Where did you go (I miss that bitch)
Shopping around looking around
I'm try to see
Where could you be
How could you do this to me (I miss that bitch)


My momma got mad
I was young when I hooked up with her
One hit and I couldn't stop trippin
A long lasting relationship
Pass you around, and let my niggas take a hit
I used to break you down just to roll you up
You the real, you never will slow me up
And you was always on my mind
Say no more
I still miss you at times
All of a sudden you lost my interest
I packed it up and set about my business
You used to have a hold on me
Sometimes to the point that they said you controlled me
I kept going to jail and all that
Get out, fuck with you again, I'm right back
I guess I had to learn the hard way baby
I'm leaving you alone cause you driving me crazy (I miss that bitch)



Ohhhhh
Mary, mary, mary
Quite contrary
Ohhhhh
Every time I think about that girl
Make a nigga wanna have a wet dream
Release some steam

Get, wicked on yo' case like Detective Van Adder
So the, sayin goes, if you snooze you lose

It seems that the Penguin is causing a stink
Call up Robin quick, you know what to do
Add dye to the water and splash the town blue

And Clayface will catch the em-brace

Takin out you suckers and you don't know how I did it


No one, can save the day like Batman
Robin, will make you sway like that and

W-Balls, it's your main man DJ E-Z Dick
About to unleash another one of those platnum plus hits
And the word is on the streets, and the word is the streets
We gon go to a live remote, licking wit my main man Mr Doggy Dogg


A day in the life, of a Rollin 20 Crip
I'm just a stuburn type of fella with a head like a brick
And just because I sip Moet, they say that I'm hopeless
But I don't give a fuck, so blame it on the loc'ness
Now this is how we do it when we checking the grip
Snoop Dogg is in this bitch, so don't even trip
I bust a funky composition that's smooth as a prism
Now check it as I kick off in this funky ass rhythm
It's six dub, the phone is ringing off the deck
And it's some homies talking about I disrespected they set
Aww nah, Dogg aint this y'all
I got couple relatives up off of Crenshaw
This is about me and Simon, not me and y'all
I got love for a bunch of real B-Dogs
Like K-Dub, Top Cat, B-Reel, E-Rock, Boo-Lay Face
And the homie Har'ron rest in peace
Big Jay from Cappinella Park
He used to blaze with his nephew after dark
On and on, rocking big neck bone
Mausberg I had to put you on my song
It's so real, I had to show some love
Now back to this scrub, it ain't about Crip or Blood
It's about you bein jealous of what I does
Cause I does it the most, the king of the coast
in the paint playin post - I back you down
like Shaq-Daddy, and bust on ya out the new Caddy
And skirt up, bust ya boulevard
I'm not Xzibit, you can't +Pull My Hoe Card+
.. I fucked all your groupies
When you was doin time in Camp Snoopy
With the fags and snitches, no killers just bitches
And you was payin niggaz off with all my riches
You so hardco', why you ain't go to level fo'?
Oh I know (bitch!)
But I walk the mainline everytime I go down
You can check my G files I do it L.B.C. style
.. I got the word on your Simon
You need to just start rhymin
Cause you the biggest star on your label
And them other niggaz just crumbs off my table
You're not able, to compete with the heat that I drop
And I still ain't been paid, for "1-8-7 on a cop"
I started yo' shit and I will end yo' shit
if you keep talkin shit on Crip!


It all boils down to the fact
that you're jealous of my paper stack (jealous ass nigga)
It all boils down to the fact
that you're jealous of my paper stack (gon get pimp slapped)


Money, I get it, paper I got it
Heaters, I keep em, bitches I got em


If I shoot you, I'll be brainless, and you'll be famous
And I'll be spending money out the anus
Your only gain is to try to get me to fall down to your level
Man you worser than devils
Alotta niggas should've said it, fuck em
But Ima say it for em, stop it, pop it, rewind and play it for em
This nigga's a bitch like his wife
Suge Knight's a bitch, and that's on my life
And I'ma let the whole world see
Cos you fucked up the industry, and that's on me
We can go head up, nigga, set it up
Or we can do the other thing, I love to wet it up
Your rappers and artists, tell em, shut it up
Cos I'll fuck every last one of em up, especially Kurupt
See that's my lil homeboy, so he knows what's up
He better keep it Crippin, and slip his clip in
Cos these niggas trippin, this is official business
Do the same way, leave no witnesses
This is that unexpected diss directed, sprayed, covered and protected
Strip you butt naked, chicky-check-check-it
It's all to the good again
You can catch Snoopy Dibby Double in the hood again
Spinning that real times, spitting that real shit
To make the whole world feel it
So put the bacon in the skillet, and try to peel it
Cause Doggystyle Records is the realest, nigga



Money, I get it, paper I got it
Heaters, I keep em, bitches I got em
Money, I get it, paper I got it

They sound so beautiful, don't you agree?
Sing it sister..
Yeah, we'd like to welcome y'all inside this R&G
Rhythm & Gangsta: The Masterpiece
Such a, heavenly experience
Alchemist, break it down for me nephew
Let me preach to 'em one time, chuuch


In the beginning as a child I was chosen
Though not knowin the reason while still my eyes opened
Whatever the purpose, I surfaced above the fog
Love was given to all, outside livin the ball
As an adolescent, one black child, I had a message
to reach teachin the masses, I wrote my first passage
It was jotted down, created in the form of a rap
I'm young, livin in the city of jackers and gangbangin
and dope dealin, cold feelin to be a product of niggaz around you
Once you get on top they down you
But the temptation got me, streets caught me watchin
I found myself grindin on the streets quite often
With a blue rag, bangin the dub, fo'-fifth coffin
At the spot, 61st, 40 blocks from the Eastside
Where most of the big homies had a glock and flossed the G-ride
Niggaz throwin up hands but it wasn't no peace signs
Never fo' a second did I think to let my light shine
Hardheaded, thought I was grown, messin up
Disrespectin my home, not carin 'bout what moms what sayin
And then I found out that mom wasn't playin
Today, I love you for it, back then, I couldn't understand
Get my life right, step it up, nigga be a man
Never be a victim, of what the system might hit you with
Through the stripes still gotta shine my light
I've grown, to comprehend the game; my name is Big Snoop Boss Dogg
Just a block and a phone call away
I've reached the status, of a modern day John Baptist
I'm preachin just what I practice
To each and all, I got a word from the Beach to acros the globe
Man woman young and old
Don't gain the world, lose your soul to spite
Many circumstances Doggy gon' shine my light cause I love you


(I love, to give you light)


And the people that is locked up, locked down
And the people that's locked dowwwwwn
Also God, should purchase the new, Escalade
On 24's, with the spinnin thangs, ha ha

Cause a lot of y'all think y'all goin to heaven huh
And you ain't gon' go!

Before I pay that bitch, I'm like a bossy hog
Half dog, half gorilla, bitch Donkey Kong
Niggaz thirst for hoes, I got a thirst to ball
Tryin to knock a pimp's hustle, be the first to fall
Fuckin with a-hundred-fifty, whole can of vodka

Help me, I'm sendin these bitch niggaz straight to God
Shit I'm too damn grown, conversation is sho't

Hugged up wit yo bitch, nigga I don't give a shit

Now step your game down, cause ain't no checkin me
You'll be respectin me until you leave this room

Walkin in my big blue chucks cause I'm killin em



 Hey whaddup cuz, it's 50 cent;
What's happnin nigga?


Ever since the moment I was born I been dyin (Yea)
Hundred miles an hour pulse flyin wit my eye an
He who fears fate lives like a coward
You go against me, you'll be devoured
Then you get to poppin you'll have a change of heart
I hit your chest a couple times you'll have to change your heart
Have doc usin donors, dead niggas with spare parts
You come back wit lungs of a snitch, an the heart of a dead nark
Niggas never see the light till it spark
Then they bleed, it get cold, then shit get dark
You can call me the beast from the east, I run these streets
You can eat hollow tip shells or you can work for me
These rap niggas crazy, my mercy has limits
Push Me - a hundred revolvers'll get to spinnin
Your services are no longer needed; Rock-a-bye baby
My bitch'll do it to you with a lil 380 (Yea)




I'm bailin thru the door again
Let the Momo pour again
Me & my ho again
Yea she got the four up in this motherfucker
And Imma bust it if you try to rush us or touch us or sucka duck us
It'll crack off, Now back off - real slow
An if you don't know, I never hesitate to shoot a ho
Yea that's my reputation - you test my patience &
You & your fam - bam - gon hear the blam, blam
Goddammit I'm at it again
They done let that bitch nigga up outta the pen
And now he lookin for me - what the heck - my game is built on respect
Now I'm breathin down your mortherfuckin neck
I dumps till my clips is empty
I'm headin down Willshire to San Vicente
And when I get there don't ask who sent me
Just take dem shots an drop it like it's hot
Bitch Nigga




Ha-ha-ha
Yea Nigga
Just when you thought I was gone
Slide back up on you like the wind nigga
Hurricane D-O-Double G
With the G,G,G,G,G, G-unit

Niggas, get your milla genuine draft, cause its milla time, we about to go hard on these hoes on
this one right here.


 Can you control your hoe? (You got a bitch that wont do what you say)
You can’t control your hoe? (She hardheaded, she just won’t obey)
Can you control your hoe? (You’ve got to know what to do, and what to say)
You’ve got to put that bitch in her place, even if it’s slapping her in her face.
Ya got to control your hoe. Can you control your hoe?

I went to your house; your girl came in and started cussing you out. You should have slapped her
in her face, I wanted to tell you, but it wasn’t my place. I kept it on the low, cause I know you
was gonna check that hoe. But instead, you was quiet as a mouse, maybe you started to think it
wasn’t your house. Cause she was acting like a nut, you got a kind of bitch that would kick your
butt. What kind of pimp holds back? Never met a bitch that a pimp can’t slap, whats wrong with
the pimpin’? Why you get a whippin’? All I got to say is this:




This is what you made me do; I really didn’t want to put hands on you. But bitch you playin’
with fire, i'm so sick and tired, of loud mouth bitches like you, a nigga had to go and put tips
on you, cause bitch you playin’ with fire, i'm so sick and tired.

This is what you forced me to do, I really didn’t want to put hands on you, but bitch you
playin’ with fire, i'm so sick and tired. Of bitches like you, a nigga had to go and put tips on
you, bitch you playin’ with fire, I’m so sick and tired.


(No: can you control your hoe? At the end.)

Roll up a fat one and pass it around
Lay back hypnotized by The Neptunes sound
My peoples always see me and they think I'm on point
So they roll me a blunt, or either pass me a joint
I'm the modern day Rick James, yeah that's me
Anything less than the best is blasphemy
So ask for me - when you wanna get spliffted
I'm not Keith Murray but I'll Get Ya Lifted
Terrific, cause this is just the linguistics
This shit's cannibalistic, so I mixed it and twisted
With the berries and cherries, the high berries
The aura is horror, man this shit is so scary!
I took another hit and then my vision got blurry
I had to pass this shit in a motherfucking hurry
I'm looking at this chick, real thick, her name is Cheri
Big fat booty and her pootie was hairy, c'mon biatch!




Nick nack patty wack, give a Dogg a bone
Naw don't gimme nothing but a handful of stones
Don't stop! I ain't finised yet
You say you got the bomb? You wanna make a bet? it's on!
I blew about three zones then took baby home
Nigga what?! Motherfucker I'm grown
I have it how I want it, did it done it and stunted
Fronted a hundred to my nigga cause he want to get blunted
Ain't nothing to it, but to do it so I did it cause I'm wit it
This is the Face Off, the one hitter quitter
It'll lay you on your back fast, sweat start to trickle
Everything is moving like you on a tricycle
You caught up in the pickle but I get you out
I blow you a charge through your nose, not your mouth
Slow down! hoe damn! you're doing too much
You're supposed to take two puffs then give the shit up, c'mon!




Yeah this is classic, fantastic, I'm blasted
I've been growing and blowing, niggaz wonder how I lasted
Well, like Jesus I fasted, for 40 days and 40 nights
I got it all mastered
Now I need a hit of that, Neptune-ology
Gangsta philosophy, yep yep I gotta be
Real high, whenever writing my novelty
Because it adds to my celebrity
So I celebrated, teledated, innovated, dominated
Orchestrated, situated, petuated, reinstated
Then I created, you're happy that I made it
Take another hit, young nigga get faded
We're going all out, smoke till ya fall out
D-O double G House all in ya mouth
The West got the best, the East got the peace
I'm out and about with a blunt in my mouth, peace!

If I didnt have no dough would you love me, if we didnt have a place to go would you still be
There or would you leave me alone when the chips are down,or would you stay around, and lay down,

Everybody clap your hands, and if you came to party with the d-o double g and the n-e double l-y band

As I take another choken toke of icky sticky stanky
Stuff a bull, pack a pipe, twist a blunt, roll and light a joint
Lean back and puff slow


Whenever I'm making a record, I'm getting into my character
And I'm trying to to portray something that I'm feeling so that way the whole world can believe in it

Do anybody know my name!?


What's my name!?
(Snoop Dogg!)
What's my name!?
(Snoop Dogg!)
Hold on, I want y'all to say my name like dis..

(Snoop, Snoop, Snoop, Snooooop)

There are seven wonders in the world, you're about to witness the eighth

 Nigga ask about me, nigga ask about me!

You don't believe me? Motherfucker say what!?
Aiyyo Cat, roll out the blue carpet cause
Lemme C-walk on these niggas

Blue hat, blue socks, blue shoes, too cool
Blue car, blue house, blue pit, blue pool
Blue grass, blue Coupe, blue b-ball hoop
What kind of phone you on Loc? I'm on the Bluetooth
Talking to my nephew, my nigga Boo, half who?
He make pimping on a bitch look so cool
Old school, old fools, steel on a nigga first
Run up with that punk shit and I fill up a nigga's shirt
Do it to it hurt 'cause it hurt so bad (so bad!)
Snoopy D O dub they can't touch yo' swag (yo' swag!)

(To get that you have to stay.. on top of your game)
(And learn the most specific lesson)
That shit is dope right there God

Yeah man

"You know it's easy to talk about.. doin somethin
but when it comes down to the action part, the most folks take a little
light vacation"


Mmmm.. I was just thinkin to myself man
Y'know this Blue Carpet Treatment record is deep to me
And I need to let my peoples know how deep it is to me
On some real talk like

It's like lookin and poppin and seein whoppers and movers
Despite a Guidant, I try to be hard on the low
Nobody's guidance so I decided to sleep by the do'
Open my mind try to slip inside my grandpa's fo'
Driftin off into another stage of life
Nigga paid ya price and big homies made ya fight
Niggaz ain't wanna see ya nigga be-bop, no
Toe for toe, I beat a nigga down to the flo'


Incredible, forgettable, better blast, past, to move the mind
Many men were eradicated by music minds
Open ya eyes and take ya time to visualize
And once ya decide to move ya mind in due time
It's so erotic, if it ain't exotic, it's gettin naughty
Freeze and groove, get rowdy, rowdy; girl move ya body
It's melodic, I'm bein honest and modest
You done fucked off my whole rap flow, think about it


Fuck that nigga, I'ma do it right
Thangs ain't movin right, I don't think that you would like
for me to be mad, saying, "Niggaz can't stand me"
Sittin at home, watchin motherfuckers at the Grammy's
Wishin I was there, naw nigga I don't wish no more
I'm the big cat, fish in the bowl
Basically you hear these rappers out here using my flow
They need Snoop on they song to make they shit official though
In dismissible, police a nigga, modern day KMI
Takin my time, chronolizing my rhyme
Writing my rhyme, tryin to get intellectual
Directing the weather, makin my negative records more intellectual
Tryin to change the direction of flowin
And sayin, born sayin, "You know I get live-er when I get fluent"

Ain't been nobody to change game since King came
Same thing, same lane, hit it and ya get banged
Word to Rob Bass, just make the music dope
Thangs don't change man, it's so remarkable
And they don't know how to do it 'cause they don't flow that way
Go that way, roll that Jay
Roll my tape and take me back the day you were phony
You're so into what ya doin but you can't get into it
You can't talk and now ya ruined but y'know I'ma do it
And now you doin it, they booing like, "You blew it! You blew it!"
I'm dippin through the universe, make 'em move the verse
Through the Luda-verse, hit the boota first
You can never beat a hoe, lemme show you how to treat a hoe
If you likin me, follow me, you so believable
(So) Got a way to get his own music out
Record executive, bounce ballin and actin bad
Take my time, with my.. great mind
Take 'em out, make mine, kicked about it
Thanks to niggaz who might make it illegal
And not rival the Beatles, and rock, rockin my peoples
And fly, fly like eagles been doin the shit like liters
And hittin y'all with heaters and walkin in my Adida's
I continue to bust, then I switched up to chucks
Givin niggaz a puff, still givin it up
Beanie Sigel what up? Real niggaz is up
On the scheme with my team, yeah Daz and Kurupt




We bust 'til we buss 'em up
(Lay Low), I know they told you not to fuck with us
Layin and playin, and sayin man, walkin in vain
Anxious for fame, my nigga tryin to walk in my lane
And tryin to.. walk in my shoes but they just don't fit
You couldn't spit the shit that I spit 'cause I'm the shit
And this is it, legit, let's split the chips
And fix, and move the work and hurt that bitch
I'm through with this!

Black folks can't never have no fun!"


These streets beeeee walking down the avenue
(Crazy!) From Hollywood to South Central!
These streets beeeee.. crazy!
Long Beach to Comptoooon!
Always up to no good! Craaaaaaaa
(Crazy!) Crazy..
Always up to no good!
Van Nuys to Santa Ana, crazy
(Crazy!)


Have a look outside and take a stroll with me
California lifestyle, you wanna roll with me?
I can take you in and out and where it's gonna be
Now as crazy as it is, you know this home for me
I wouldn't never leave it, you know that's wrong of me
I'ma stay down, you see me on them corners G
At your local liquor store, getting some optimums
And if I'm out of bounds then I gotta cock the fo'
Keep it on the low on the W-W-W-West coast
Sign some autographs and then I do get ghost
A-humph.. yeah, I love my folks
But half of y'all fools is cutthroats
On the real no.. the streets'll have you
Guide you, lead you, mislead you, it's fragile
Yeah, see you gradually grow
and when you walking on my side I think you all need to know




On the 110 Freeway flo', back to the block
In the seven deuce Coupe, hopping hipping the hop
Sipping on some Henn with my nephew Infrared
Young pimp on the grind tryna line up some head
Had fun, did, done, on the West we run
Don't matter where you from, if you old or young
Seesaw we raw like ooohhh-la-la
Fuck the law we don't get caught we just do-da-da
Yeah nigga we shaking the cops
You niggas out there just be making it hot
But don't trip if you faking a lot
I'll break you, shake you, and take yo' spot
 Because if you think that you gonna slip through California
without getting banged on.. brother you're wrong


(Always up to no good!) I really love my dog, grew up together and all but he
(Always up to no good!) Hell yeah I love New York
that's why I married the broad but she
(Always up to no good!) We can't hang 'em up 'cause I'm a balla y'all and he
(Always up to no good!) Let me tell you about these streeeets
(Always up to no good!)

Man, don't you know that I'm loco?

I was chilling right around my way
21st Eastside at the beach
This motherfucker ran up on me
Talking shit with his homies
Like he was a straight G!

Asking where I'm from while he running up
Gangbang my set on everyone of them
(20s nigga)
Some things, sons they just won't change
Fools don't respect nothing but the gangbang

What's seen is what's sawn
Dogg is the law
I have you niggas running like a marathon
Lil G's tryna creep on the East with it
Talking 'bout they gon' get my chain, and they gon' leave with it

But they don't know
Once they get close
It's tic tac toe
Three motherfuckers laid on the floor
(Watch out)
Yeah, this happened yesterday
On the West they spray
I heard an ese say
He said

Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw these pack of guys, and they act real hard
(And what they do?)
They twist their fingers say, "You know who we are."
He said, "I don't give a fuck. I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg."
(Ah huh)
They keep fucking, and it went too far
So Snoopy—he went straight to the trunk of his car
(And what he get?)
He got his gun, and they start running hard
He started firing and then he just charged

Blaow!
Run, nigga, run, nigga
Blaow
Duck, nigga, duck, nigga
Blaow
Run, motherfucker, run
Blaow
Run, motherfucker, run

Blaow
Run, nigga, run, nigga
Blaow

Run, motherfucker, run

I didn't mean to hit what I hit
Now that's 3 motherfuckers dead, and I ain't seen shit
But these niggas 'a scream with plea
But for a G like me it's just a case
Really you could see

I crack the Mac back
And pop off rolling
And smack your neck back
You drop off falling
I haven't seen my mama in a week
And she ain't even ran her mouth about me

Fuck that. I ain't give a fuck about the law
Niggas say they wanna brawl
You would think that they were brawlers
Believing all the things that you never saw
In it y'all? Been a Dogg
Smoke you like a menthol

You think you know?
But this can't go
You think you'll blow on my dough?
What the fuck? No

See these niggas proceed with speed
So feel the need to bleed
All you'll hear my enemies going

Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw these pack of guys, and they act real hard
(And what they do?)
They twist their fingers say, "You know who we are."
He said, "I don't give a fuck. I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg."
(Ah huh)
They keep fucking, and it went too far
So Snoopy—he went straight to the trunk of his car
(And what he get?)
He got his gun, and they start running hard

Run, motherfucker, run

I wouldn't be the nigga that I am
If I didn't pop niggas in their mouth
God damn
And Snoop 'a keep one foot on the streets
And leave 'em covered in sheets
Run with them niggas with the heat

You never seen a thug like this
You never seen a dub like me
And I ain't weak for wanting peace
In fact, I could be beast of the East, motherfucker

I never hesitate to blaze
A nigga really tryna change his ways
We gotta move my team 'cause my peoples
Are screaming that we need more
For fun or is it legal

Put the bang on this song
Make it feel like a drive-by
It's a shame but somebody gotta die
They say it happens state to state
But when I mobbing LA
All I hear the eses say
They go

Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw these pack of guys, and they act real hard
(And what they do?)
They twist their fingers say, "You know who we are."
He said, "I don't give a fuck. I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg."

Dancing titty bar style

Snoop Dizzle (Hey)
Your boy Kells (Hey)
Let me hear you say
That's that shit


Let's get this party jumpin'
Me and Kel gone get it bumpin'
They humpin'
Like when it's over
We gone all get into somethin'
The Dog is fresh
Southside without a vest
Nothin on my chest
But these ladies up out the Midwest
I must confess
That in the Chi is so blessed
Leaving nothing on my mind
But Doggy, you and safe sex
This ain't a test
You fucking with a cold mess
Meet me in Chicago
Let me get you to this real west
It's real strong
Real fat and real long
Doggies in the building
Holdin' something they can feel up on
And once they get it
Something they can build up on
Take that skinny nigga home
Work that filling till it's gone
Get that home grown
Put that shit on Daddy long
I know how you ladies do it
T-shirt with no panties on
Let's get this shit crackin'
Kell and Doggy Dogg in action
If you in here all alone
You might get this dog bone




I pull up, whip low in the Phantom

Got themselves another body
Knockin' out
Without protection though
That's my confession
But at the spot
If you just think
Your gonna listen
You can drop it like it's hot
Hold up
I came to cool out
Lay back and get blown
Maybe Henny, maybe gin
A couple shots of Patron
And if you didn't you missed it
But now it's known
That this cash shit
Kells sing that song

West Coast it's time to stand up nigga
We gon' unite 'round this motherfucker one time
I'm callin' every real Crip nigga
and every real B-Dogg, to the table right now
Yeah we gon' push a real line right now
See if y'all with this real gangsta guerrilla shit

Have you ever seen 100,000 Rip riders from the side
Blue Chuck's, blue rags, grey clouds, blue skies
On the move, can't lose, Hill Street blues
Niggaz gotta pay they dues on the crews or with the uzi spray
these suckas then I cruise, my granny saw it on the news
She shook up, look up and then she put me on the move
I tried to get away, but I couldn't get far
Cause the homies had the loop-loop that night at King Park
And I got into a squab, got caught and went to jail
Straight to the County with no motherfuckin' bail
4800 with this Crippin', oh well
My big homie Boy Blue snatched me by my coattail
He said trip Dogg, ya better get right, Crip right
Eyes open 'cause niggaz get stuck on seez-ight
It ain't no motherfuckin' problem - pop-pop, tick-tock
Never flip-flop, 20 Crippin' til I drop


Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip
So whooot, so whooot, so whooot, so whooot
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip
So whooot, so whooot, so whooot, so whooot
Ca-rip


Is I, in the motherfuckin' S-5
With the red bandana double knotted 'round the rearview
Niggaz see clear through, they know that it's Game
Cherry red Lowenhart's let 'em know that I bang
So bang, like Snoop in "Deep Cover"
I got the seat reclined, fo-five under the white-T, smothered
Dippin' down Green Leaf, I ain't got no enemies
Been shot five times, now I bleed Hennessy
And bang for my niggaz locked up, they can't stop us
It ain't a gangsta party 'til we go and dig Pac up
I'm Dr. Martin Luther King with two guns on
Hughey P. Lewis with Air Force One's on
I gangbang but I'm the opposite of Tookie Williams
Red Lambo', red bandana print ceilin'
Me and Snoop got the West Coast locked
Red and blue rag tied in a knot
With all my motherfuckin' homies yellin' out


So whooot, so whooot, so whooot, so whooot
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip
So whooot, so whooot, so whooot, so whooot
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip


I ran outta gas in Long Beach, I'm stuck
Ain't no Bloods and all I see is blue Chuck's
Hopped out the '6-trey, nowhere to go
Til' Snoop pulled up in that Pittsburgh Steeler '6-4
We "Just Dippin", one Bloodin' one Crippin'
I'm on that Bulls shit, throwback Scott' Pippen
Moral is, my bandana hangin' from the left side
So if you ain't a Crip or a Blood, just throw up Westside


(What up Blood?) Yeah cuz, we just tippin'
Me and Game doin' thangs, switchin' lanes, Hurricanes on my feet
Stop, and C-Walk to the beat
Game, take the wheel and turn on 21st Street
Eastside LBC, gun in my hand
It's the turf by the surf but we don't play in the sand
We just - slip and slide out, we Rip and ride out
Let it C known, nigga welcome to the Thunderdome


Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip
So whooot, so whooot, so whooot, so whooot
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip
So whooot, so whooot, so whooot, so whooot
So whooot, so whooot, so whooot, so whooot
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip

Some of 'em lie about the shit they got and what they do on the block
Some of 'em lie about the guns they pop
But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
That's how it is for me 'cause I live a boss' life
So many niggaz wanna play but still got dues to pay
Some of 'em gotta beg a bitch to stay
But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
That's how it is for me 'cause I live a boss' life
Now this is for the Bs and the Cs, and the Ds and the Hs
And the Gs putting work in overseas
At ease with the Doggy and smoke some weed
Fuck it, if my nigga detoxing, it's more for me
Baby this is presidential really
A pocket full of women understanding how I'm living
Show them hoes how you winning
It's the beginning with the pearls you're given
The world soft like linen and sweet like cinnamon
But everyday like 50 say, it's Many Men
They wanna take me out the spot, they want the pussy and the ends
But separate the paper and the Benz and the cribs
Then the hoes, then the clothes, I'ma have to let 'em go
You know how the Dogg roll. Don't get it twisted
'Cause he bang out the East just in case you wanna visit
A touch of the exquisite, mixed with something pimpish
And it's coming from the beach where them niggaz is a beast
But I just listen, all that shit is in my past
I'm connected to the purse first nigga.. the ass last
From Long Beach to Venice is the premise
Want the green like spinach and I'm strong to the finish


See me man, I'm nothing like you
I got the kinda swagger that you ain't used to
I'm leaning in my ride, fo' fifth, cock banging
Me, I'm riding by ya on the corner, block slangin
I'm living that boss' life (life)
The hoes come running when they see me coming
I'm living that boss' life (life)
You can have anything just don't fuck with my money (my money)


This is for the West and the East and the Dirty South
Khaki's and them Tim's and them niggaz with the platinum mouths
Thinking that they blessed by the actions that be coming out
When you in Magic City you be carrying a lot of clout
But tricking ain't the route (route), that's even if you got it
There's a method to you holding it when they can't do without it
Just put the key up in it nigga if she 'bout it
You can have her and her partner, fucking with it for a dollar
If she a balla, she gon' ride with a shot caller
Roll with the Bo$$ Dogg in the back of a blue Impala
And if she follow then she gon' swallow
All the game you got to give her, be a different bitch tomorrow
But I would never bother breaking out (Tha Doggfather)
'Less I knew that she was 'bout him, having diamonds on his collar
I'm just an author, spreading game to my partners
Walking on the blue carpet with the Doctor (Doctor)

Oh Cali?
"No doubt"

"LAX"
"Oh Cali?"
"No doubt baby" -


West West y'all, pile it on your plate
A little somethin' somethin' from the Golden State
Nah, we ain't like Kobe and Shaq
It's Magic and Kareem nigga, Showtime is back
True legends, two steppin' on you peasants
What y'all thought, y'all gon' need bout two vests'
Cause we he plug, I plug
Mixed shot with the slug, listen here cuh
when I dig dug - play slick and get stuck
But don't play tough boy, go and get it up
Hey yo Cube, tell me this
Why half of the homies gettin' worked by a bitch?
Then they fall in love and get hurt by a bitch
Nine months later cause got mirked by a bitch
See I'm just a nigga that ya don't wanna
Reverse the game on her, put the bitch on a corner
Welcome to California

"LAX"

L-A-X, top down nigga
I'm scoopin' you up, ya rollin' or what?
I know what ya came for, I'm rollin' it up
Snoop Dogg nigga, y'all hold up
Never thought Ice Cube would show up
But I'm in the studio gettin' fucked up
with a beat from Battlecat, a nigga lucked up
I got my hustle down, look and learn
See how a hot nigga, cook and burn
A nigga earn like David Stern
mixed with Big Worm when he off that sherm
Now - bust a u-turn, come by your hood
For motherfuckers that think I went Hollywood
Pick a Coast, it got to be the West
I live out there, from the W.S. nigga

"LAX"
"Oh Cali?"
"No doubt baby"
"LAX"
(Welcome to Cali)
"Oh Cali?"
"No doubt baby"

Fell asleep on the plane, and so did he
Woke up chillin' in the LBC
I grew up in the HNC
But that ain't what I turned out to be
Understand me that I'm still a G
who ain't never spent a day in the penitentiary
Now I'm rappin' with Snoop D-O double-G
And got the whole fuckin' world nigga lovin' me


Yep yep, they love him to death
Cause he walk under water, without gettin' wet
Roll through the neighborhood without gettin' checked
So gone and so blown, are we there yet?
You wonder why I got the S on my chest
cause I'm a motherfuckin' vet from the Wild Wild West
I used to sing "Bennie and the Jets"
Nigga so boss now I sip Henny on my jets
From the East back to the West

"LAX"
"Oh Cali?"
"No doubt baby"
"LAX"
"Oh Cali?"
"No doubt baby"
(Welcome to Cali)
"LAX"
"Oh Cali?"
"No doubt baby"
(Welcome to Cali)
"LAX"
"Oh Cali?"

(Welcome to Cali)

Ten little Crip niggaz runnin outside
All from the turf and they bangin out lives
Far from a scrub cuzz from the Eastside
Where they don't die they just multiply
So.. don't give them niggaz a reason
To turn it into spray season
Don't give them niggaz a reason
Because they'll turn it into Crip season


The gangsta's back, the bank is fat
The gangsta mack, in a gangsta 'llac
Hmm.. fools be like, "Break off some cheese"
Friends and enemies, aww nigga please
Fuck, you thought who pumped you up
Stop, you stuck too much, pop, drop, you plucked
It's all similar to gettin laaaid
on ya back when the motherfuckin K spraaays
I grind for my shine about my bidness
Lunatic on the shit and I get ignit (ignit)
Gonna proceed to squeeze with ease
One of these, they can't believe how I leave 'em
Look into a mind of a nigga that's crazy
Seventeen years old and still a baby
Gangstas real, they pop the pill
You cap back, young motherfucker it's like that




Wake up in the morning lookin funny and shit
Fuck a honey dip.. 'cause I got money to get
Ain't no books, ain't no help, ain't no role to this
Stay focused young homey, that's the code to this
Keep a strap in ya pocket when ya tip through the towns
There's a million motherfuckers tryna get you down
A lot of pain in this game, cocaine is the thang
If ya money right then you might get you a chain
But if ya money is low, there's only one way to go
Jack a rapper at a local rap radio show
So mean, so green, crip back to the block
Then brag to the homies, show 'em what you got
It's a gangsta jack (gangsta jack), in gangsta black (black)
And they thought we just gangsta rapped
Yeah nigga, we take your snaps
Your shooby dooby, hooroobies, and your Scooby snacks (It's like that?)
It's like that!




It's a whole lot of fillin when you on the Eastside
On the Eastside, nigga we ride
And it's a whole lot of dealin when you on the Eastside
On the Eastside, nigga we ride
And it's a whole lot of stealin when you on the Eastside
On the Eastside, nigga we ride
And it's a whole lot of killin when you on the Eastside
Eastside, yeah nigga we ride




They say it's crazy out here, it ain't no more fun
I can't walk down the street without my gun, gun

It ain't safe to leave the house
Fuck around 'round here
These niggaz quick to air ya out
and lay ya down 'round here
You run your mouth niggaz will put ya
in the ground 'round here
One-time don't even fuck around and come 'round here


M.L. and 21st, where niggaz worse
Quick to put one in ya first
Before they search your pockets get that china
And where they got ya that's where they gon' find ya
They rollin' out there nigga, that's that real shit
Where bein' slick can get you caught up real quick
Hold up homie, don't let this money blind ya
Cause you won't see me standin' right behind ya
Then it's time's up, that's how we talkin' if he come from the Beach
Better watch them niggaz out here if they come from the East
Don't stop if I'm not out somewhere so niggaz can see
Cause they don't give a fuck, you stuck if you ain't with me
My city's a beast..
You can't walk through the Beach unless you walk with a piece
You can't talk to police 'cause most police is like me
They get that cheddar like they want it, take yo' shit in the street
They want that paper out here
Enough to come and take what's on your plate out here
Enough to have somebody take your place out here
Fuckin' around without your strap sound like a bad idea


It ain't safe to leave the house
Fuck around 'round here
These niggaz quick to air ya out
and lay ya down 'round here
You run your mouth niggaz will put ya
in the ground 'round here
One-time don't even fuck around and come 'round here


This L.A. County nigga
If you's a bitch then get yo' ass from 'round here nigga
Before they come put bullets in yo' brain
Cause in the hood ain't nothin' really changed
They tryin' to get that paper just like Uncle Sam
And just like Sam niggaz just don't give a damn
They mission is to leave yo' ass in pain
Cause they don't give a fuck about a thing
It's a cold game, that's how they talkin' if they walk on the West
Better watch yourself without this star protectin' your chest
These niggaz come from nowhere, get to takin' yo' shit
You'll get beat outside the set and then sent home in your stretch
This shit is a mess..
You can't walk in them streets unless you walk with your vest
You can't talk to police 'cause most police ain't gon' stress
They get that cheddar like they want it with they foot in your chest
They want that paper out here
Enough to come and take what's on your plate out here
Enough to have somebody take your place out here
Fuckin' around without your strap sound like a bad idea


It ain't safe to leave the house
Fuck around 'round here
These niggaz quick to air ya out
and lay ya down 'round here
You run your mouth niggaz will put ya
in the ground 'round here
One-time don't even fuck around and come 'round here

Good evening ladies and gentlemen
 "Let's describe a certain female"


Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
It's gettin, it's gettin, it's gettin kind of heavy
Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
It's gettin, it's gettin, it's gettin kind of heavy
Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
It's gettin, it's gettin, it's gettin kind of heavy


It all goes back, to '85
When I start gettin pussy every day of my life
It really didn't matter what the bitch look like
I remember one night, after the Sugar Ray fight
Wouldn't you believe it, Dogg like a retriever
I went up in this big fat bitch named Treva
She had a best friend with titties named Vanessa
She told me to undress her, yessir
Ain't no pressure, later that semester
She put me down with her homegirl name Tanisha
She was so vicious, lips so luscious
Suck a nigga dick and have it shinin like some dishes
Patricia, Patricia, she love the way I stick her
I take her to the movies and now, she eat the dick up
Big bucks, no whammies
I had to meet this white bitch, her name was Tammy
She lived in the Valley, she couldn't understand me
But she let me dig out, her homegirl named Brandi
Now Brandi was a cute little thick bitch
She moved to the hood from the 2-oh-6
She brought some new tricks, flippin them squirrels
And the pearls, and turnin out the neighborhood little girls
Hmm, and I seen that, so I peep the game
So I put her down, bottom bitch on my team
And we began makin, breakin bitches takin
whatever we want, see she want with the fakin
It's real in the field, no mistakin
And crack the little bitch, yeah she Jamaican
Time and time again she would bring me bud
And let me beat it up, listenin to "One Love"
Off some jerk chicken, I got mo' bitches
Now I'm fuckin her sister it's gettin real suspicious
But the dick is good, so they won't tell
And now they next door neighbor, Clarissa Bell
She been lookin at me, I think she wanna hit
But I'ma holla back, cause I'm on another bitch
I'm on some other shit, I got a phone call
From the motherfuckin president y'all
He said, "Snoop Dogg, how could I fuck a bitch
and make her suck a dick and not get caught for the fuck of it?"
I called and look here, this what you do
Make the First Lady sell a little pussy for you
I think he got it, cause he left fast
He left his daughters, and a lot of cash
Well what do ya know, D-O-double-G
Major pimpin, out in D.C.
And I'm a young pimp, got a lot of growin left
And you's a young hoe with a lot of hoein left
Always keep a hoe in check, blowin us a train wreck
Yeah I might have to go in depth
See every little hoe I met
They're standouts, you know the ones like Yvette
We fucked in the car, behind a bar
I shot it in her face and it went "Ahhh"
My homeboy Charles
Went up in his sister, behind the garage
I was menace, I was freaky, I was sick
When y'all was tryin to hump, I was teachin them to suck dick
Always tryin to go up in a hoe
Got caught tryin to fuck in school they asked me what I did it fo'
You know just what I told her?
I love pussy, and this dick is what I showed her
And now they threw me out, now I'm at the pad
I'm at a new school, way cool
New hoes, new script, fresh fish
Walk up in the room and I bust a new bitch
I'm in some new tail, wanna holla back
But for now let me holla back Impala black
She's a 12th grader, in my science class
And I done seen the pussy, yeah boy I'm movin fast
See I was taught by, and I was taught I
better move on somethin fast if I thought I
could claim a dame, or game her brain
Or tame a man, not with the same old game
See on some different stuff, I'm a different cut
It's what I say and do to make the bitch give it up
Oh you wanna brag? I wanna brag too
Now what you gon' do, when they ask you
Is you gon' tell a lie, or you gon' keep it G
Or you gon' hold it all inside or you gon' tell on me?
Shit it's all cool, cause it was all good
It's just another day in Doggy Dogg's neighborhood
You better watch your girl, cause if she on the loose
It's a 90 percent chance she gon' get pimp juice
Now what it do, what it is
Now you livin with that hoe and y'all got fo' kids

Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
It's gettin, it's gettin kind of heavy
Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
It's gettin, it's gettin kind of heavy
Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
It's gettin, it's gettin kind of heavy

Yo Doc what up my nigga
Snoop Dogg, it is what it is
This record is so motherfuckin' gangsta man
And i think it's time for me and you to just
Turn it down a bit
Come on


Imagine it never happened
Imagine no rappin'
Imagine niggaz trapped
Imagine it havin' action
Imagine how niggaz could be actin'
If you never got this shit crackin
Imagine life's so hard
You can't imagine it's like livin' in city of god
You feel me
Imagine life on the yard
I'm tryin' to get that dollar on some shitty ass job
Imagine Biggie with his son
Imagine Pac gettin' call pop 'bout one
Imagine a mother strugling
Dealing with a system that don't give a fuck about who shot her son
Imagine life you can't win
When you get out of the ghetto and go right to the pen
When you get out to the pen you go right to the jenz
When you put back to the streets you get right back in
Imagine Russell still strugling
No Def Jam it's anotoher nigga hustlin'
And no rocks on them fellaz
Just rocks on them fellaz
Just try and keep it bubblin'
Imagine niggaz just stoped
From the east to the west coast, everybody fucked up
I can't imagine no less
But it don't take imagination
To know niggaz been bless with
HIP-HOP


Before we go
Can you imagine?
Picture years, with your mom
Can you imagine?
Hang her picture in the sky
Can you imagine?
Call emergency I've been dreamin' all my life.


Could you imagine bein' lit up by some hot shells?
Imagine being tossed around and put in jails
Imagine life when you can't get from under
Imagine niggaz at ya when you done fo'
Remember when they asks ya why ya run for and treat ya like a bitch
When they kick you in your dick and take your shit
We act like we hate to see you gun hoe
But just imagine if the rappin' got the gun no but you already know.
Imagine niggaz in the LBC felt just like Snoop Dogg & D-R-E,
And felt just like the niggaz in the 2-1-3.
Then imagine us was comin' when you fuckin' with me.
Imagine you was up on top of this shit
Imagine if the bitches could stay off this dick
I mean imagine we said fuck this shit
Imagine if my niggaz got together and tow up this bitch, yeah
You can't imagine growin' up in the jail done
Happy just to be alive' watching all your people run
Would you imagine growin' up to sell your 50 million records world wide or fuckin' on somebodies son
Imagine if these niggaz neva saw a colour
Would it be peaceful in them streets where niggaz kill each other
All the drunk fool gets pissed on balls
He fuckin' off my niggaz, they gone murder us all
Imagine that

Brothers is wack by popular demand
Chasin fame and girls livin they life on cruise control
But tell me; what do it profit a man
to gain a whole world livin trife but then lose his soul?
I'm here to wake my peoples up from they dreamin
Kill every demon and snakes that make, even feds steamin
Even though my star gleamin man my life ain't trouble-free
Homie take it from me, Snoopy D-O-double-G


It's no better people who have left the problems of today
Leavin to conclude that for their life is not the way
But every problem has an answer, and if yours you cannot find
You can talk it over to Him, He'll give you piece of mind
When you feel your life's too harrr-arrrrrd
Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood
Heyyyyyyeahhhheyyyy


So much drama on the ave, the copper just laughed
Man the West is wild, that old hit was wrong
Cause out here, momma don't have, and poppa don't have
As God blessed the child that can go get his own
And we struggle hard suffer long, I'm feelin like this life is a trip
Tryin to keep our hearts pure through the sins
But the race ain't to the swift or the strong, the wise or the rich
But to them they can endure to the end and win


When you feel your life's too harrr-arrrrrd
Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood yeahhhheyyyy

Out here the only free psychiatrist, that's known throughout the world
Is fall in love by walks of all men and women, it's all boys and girls
When you feel your life's too harrr-arrrrrd
Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood


Whether it's soldiers on the cell block or homies on the run
With God, man ain't no obstacles that you can't overcome


When you feel your life's too harrr-arrrrrd
Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood


You're so frustrated, worryin 'bout your bread
And some mornings, you don't even wanna get out the bed


When you lose too much too baaaaaaad
Just go talk to God and prayyyyy


And you's a good women, but you can't understand
why it seems like you ain't never gon' find yourself a good man


When you feel your life's too HARRR-ARRRRRD
Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood


Mothers on welfare or ladies that's strippin
You under so much pressure, feel like your sanity's slippin


When you feel your life's too harrr-arrrrrd!
Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood, hmmm
He'll never never let you down

 You know that, don't you Snoop?
 You know I know it Uncle Steven
 Oh I know that too, we know it
 Yeah we do
 Thanks a lot man
 Nah thank you man I appreciate that, you know I love you
 And I love you for what you sayin
 God bless you


And you can catch me down on my knees, askin the Lord please
Even Jes' pray, hey, with difficulty comes ease
There's disease, poverty, congestion or oppression
I'm askin for your protection and thanking you for your blessing
Confession is good for the soul, that's how I'm tryna roll
Be one of the greats, see the Pearly Gates now that's the goal
Until then, forgive my sin if that ain't askin too much
Now that's tabernacle, chuuuch!

Spinnin' the globe like the strobe
Like the club packed, my flow right the whole night
If I plan to go right, a cold night
in hell before I fail, I'm alright
Man, I'm like a flash of lightnin'
Breath of fresh air, classic debonair
Glass of champagne, hold it in my right hand
Finger roll cold, Dogg the Ice Man

The talk of the town, believe it or doubt it
I don't need to shout it, you better read about it

I got my hands where you'll let me
I love it when you dance, so sexy
I love it when you in that night mood
Slow motion movin' like ain't nothin' like you
I'm feelin' good doin' what I like to
Suited up, pimp stripe, light blue
I let it do what it might do
Fresh and crispy, the rest a mystery
I'm blessed with history
No less than best, catch the rest
Live in the flesh, smooth with the style I choose
Not off the stress, I'm hot off the press

Been around tha world
I've been into many places seen some unfamiliar faces
But baby none of them compares to you
Soon as I get home I'm racing to unplug my phone

I seen everything twice
Been around tha world, I've seen every scene twice
Stopping down in Tokyo, dipping in the rice
I'm a boss at the wind, I cracked every colored dice

I do it big, fuck the rumors
Rich and infamous with the blue and gray Pumas
Gangstas don't die, they just move to Miami
I did all that, I was voted

I'm sorta like Sammy
Smoother than Marvin, I need me a Tammy
Sipping Chardinae, making deals on my hands free
Fatherhood, now the actors can't stand me
'Cause I own rap and I'm coming for your day job

Until then I'm chilling at the day spa
Relax my mind and just chill
'Cause without you none of this is real
Baby you know I

Been around tha world
I've been into many places, seen some unfamiliar faces
But baby none of them compares to you
Soon as I get home I'm racing to unplug my phone

Yeah, but now I'm back across the water
I'm in Sydney with somebody's daughter
Blowing sticky by the zips and they can tell
By my rag hanging, fuck this is Crip, but I'm chilling

It feels so good to get away
Especially when your name is D O double Gizzee
Coast to coast jetting, man I been doing that
What's up, just start balling  I been around the track

Hop in Peas with the bosses
300 for the yacht, the third deck got a office
Docking down in Monaco, churching with my folks
Bad luck had me dying when I fell up out that boat

My life is like a movie
But the bad guy don't die at the end, so sue me
Then I relax and chill
'Cause without you none of this is real
Baby you know I

Been around tha world
I've been into many places, seen some unfamiliar faces
But baby none of them compares to you
Soon as I get home I'm racing to unplug my phone

Been around tha world

Player it's your time to (Make It Good)


Now you've been waitin', patient
Dinner datin', classic chasin'
Your homies hatin', 'cause you're never around
You're either at the movies or you're out shoppin' around
All that for the cat, it's a wrap
You gotta go hard if you get a chance to hit that
If you hit it then you gotta hit it harder
than any other brotha, the Karma Sutra be the author
Be her father, be a man, be the man

Make it better than good, make it great
Make her visit, then make her stay

One shot to pop, better hit the spot
Cause there's a hundred other brothas that's waitin' in line
Player it's your time to (Make It Good)


Yeah man, if you got a real one
You better hold on to her
See 'cause a real man will come along the way
And smooth knock her

If you like her, wife her
If you love her, smother her
With that stuff that'll make her feel the same way
And pull that ring out on the same day
A couple heirs with the horse and the carriage
You gon' lose if you scared of marriage
A real boss got a foundation
You need somebody in your life with patience

It's your mama, your daddy, and then it's me
Bad talk a boss, I wish a player would
Close your eyes baby girl, let me (Make It Good)

Bada-bing, bada-boom, what a dogg gotta do?
Let me holler at you boo, damn I miss you
I just wanna kiss you, and all that good stuff
Was I really all that bad or was I good enough?
I'm under pressure, I can't run plays like this
My mama always said that there'll be days like this
I'm all alone by the phone, in a zone, face is stone
Wonderin', if you ever comin' home
I try to run the streets and play
But that feeling just won't go away
My whole life I'd throw away, to get you back on my team
Damn, why'd you have to go away?


I miss your breakfast in the mornin'
Miss you in the evenin', tell me why you're leavin'
Please give me a reason, nothin' could ever change me
I'm missin' my baby, think I'm goin' crazy

(Why did you leave me?)
You can't leave me by myself like this
You can't leave me by myself like this
(Why did you leave me?)
You can't leave me by myself like this
Mama told me there'll be days like this


I get up early in the mornin', miss your rudeness and kissin'
I also miss that smell of that good breakfast in the kitchen
Listen, I'm a star but I'm wishin'
To follow you wherever you are
You the wheels to my car, and I can't roll without you
My heart is a ice box, it's cold without you
Why'd you have to, leave me this way?
I'm doin' bad, you don't wanna see me this way
I'm at the pad, tryin' to do my best
I'm so stressed, and yes I'm still the King of the West
Tryin' to manage, and I'm gon' handle it
I need you back in my life, 'cause I'm tired of livin' scandalous


I miss your breakfast in the mornin'
Miss you in the evenin', tell me why you're leavin'
Please give me a reason, nothin' could ever change me
I'm missin' my baby, think I'm goin' crazy

(Why did you leave me?)
You can't leave me by myself like this
You can't leave me by myself like this
(Why did you leave me?)
You can't leave me by myself like this
Mama told me there'll be days like this


Oh my Lord, I'm sittin' at the board with my head down
I can't write my next line, I need to lay it down
Hmm, I'm stuck like a dump truck
Lookin' stupid, cupid down on my luck
I touch a four leaf clover
Hopin' for somethin' good, like I should
If not I guess it's over
Baby be real with it
Do you love me, do you miss me?
I can't deal with it


I miss your breakfast in the mornin'
Miss you in the evenin', tell me why you're leavin'
Please give me a reason, nothin' could ever change me
I'm missin' my baby, think I'm goin' crazy

(Why did you leave me?)
You can't leave me by myself like this
You can't leave me by myself like this
(Why did you leave me?)
You can't leave me by myself like this
Mama told me there'll be days like this

I'm a man I gotta take care of my family
Fighting these precious in my life
I know my mind should be on shining and getting Grammies
But these streets won't say a goodbye

I can't say goodbye
To the blocks
Goodbye
To the hood
Goodbye
To the streets (to my problems)
I can't say goodbye
To the hood
Goodbye
To the blocks
Goodbye
To the streets
I can't say goodbye goodbye
To the blocks
Goodbye
To the streets
Goodbye
To the hood
I can't say goodbye
To the hood
Goodbye
To the blocks
Goodbye
To the homies


I guess it's true, you can't take the hood out a homeboy
Plus, my hood just lost another homeboy
Another one got life, and we don't know, if he coming home boy
They in the street tell me "just leave it alone boy,
Let them do them take care of your own boy"
But I said back brake a bound, before I was drome boy
You had dreams of being a dope boy
Yeah, I was runnin' from the po po
Banging for the truth, late night huntin'
Puttin' me in work, good day comin', airbrush, shirt,
Pay day, get the spot, got my hair cut first
Made mom sick when I wouldn't go to church
Yeah I live in the burbs, but I think 21st
I know since I left that it's gotten much worse
But I'd still be there, if I couldn't write a verse




To the the blocks that raise me, the enemies and the homies that made
Me, tough enough to hang on the corners that would moul me
Critics wonder if I'm tryna be the old me,
But if the thing the old me ever left, then they don't really know me,
And don't know, we don't change, we just become OG, you always addicted
To the life, you just don't OD, I owe the streets before they owe me
Took me in when my momma didn't want me, to wild to be a child, and cops
Not around now, all I got now is the homies, to teach me, how to be a man
In what not, how to brake ounces in the grams ??
The reason I'm so nice with my hands ?? shit, you think I forgot, man




Thank good every day that the boy could spit
And all around the world they enjoyin' my shit
I know I got plenty more awards to get
I got a, beautiful wife and some gorgeous kids
But it wouldn't be right if I ignore the shit
They made me how I am, the music in the man
Told me that I can for the world gave a damn
If it wasn't for my shit, they sayin' stick to the plan
Probably be a gun instead of a pen in my hand
Probably be doin' a dub and the pin with my man
The say leaders streets but they don't really understand
All I had was the block, when I didn't have fans
Wrapped on the corners when I couldn't get spins
All I had was the homies when I didn't have kids
If it all come down and my carrier was to end, I'm sure my name
Would live.. in the streets



I just can't say goodbye

I can't say goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
I can't say goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
I can't say goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
I can't say goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

You can take the man out the streets,
But you can't take the streets out the man

Remember man, '92, me, Dre, Tha Pound, Rage, it was just all about, you know what I'm sayin', Death Row
As time went by, you know, niggas start having money, success, bitches, weed, cars, homes, you know what I'm sayin', the flyest shit
Along with that comes jealousy, envy, destruction, and along those lines run life and death
You know, so a few years went by, a couple albums, success, out of the blue sky Dre departs, he leaves us
Death Row, will we sink or will we stay afloat?
Later on that year, I lose my nigga Pac, damn, it's a cold world
Guess it's all on me, Death Row for life
Gotsta handle my businesson the frontline.as usual


Oh but what will you say
If I never set foot in your door again
What will you say to your friends then
Will you tell them
Who has the last laugh now

Yeah, this is a story about a famous dog
Doggy Dogg that is
That smooth macadamian, a.k.a Silky Slim
Back in the motherfuckin' house for nine-trey
Why must he be like that?
Why would any other dog hit it from the back?
It's in his nature, it's Doggystyle baby


(Oh I, oh I) It's Doggystyle (oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh)
Doggystyle (I)
Doggystyle, it's Doggystyle
(Oh I, oh I) Yeah it's Doggystyle (oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh)
It's Doggystyle yay (I)


It's like tonight is the night by Betty Wright
It's my first piece of ass and it's awfully tight
But I'm still finna handle my business like a dog
Feeling that pussy, yes y'all
So lay back baby girl, and take a trip with me
I got the drink on deck, so take a sip with me
Drip with me, while I swing my thang
Reminiscing 'bout the first time Doggy Dogg came


It's time to take you motherfuckas down memory lane
(Memory lane, memory lane, Doggystyle)
It's time to take you motherfuckas down memory lane
(Down memory lane, Doggystyle)
Oh I, oh I, oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh (yeah) I (yeah, Doggystyle)
Oh I, oh I, (yeah) oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh (yeah, Doggystyle)
I (Doggystyle)


It was a hot sunny day in the month of May
I'm next door to the house with my homie J
Instead of being at school, I'd rather ditch and shit
Cause at one-forty-five I got a bitch to get with
Even though I'm young, I'm kind of real good
With working my thang to get a bitch sprung
She gazing in the mirror and shit
Cause once I'm in it from the back all I'm hearing is shit is


Once you get near, the pussy gets clearer
(I can see it)
I will do things to blow your socks off
(I can feel it)
Once you get near, the pussy gets clearer
(Doggystyle, Doggystyle)
I will do things to blow your socks off
(Yeah)


A little something for the bitches thats down with me
Keep it low as you creep and get around with me
Don't be afraid like Erin ho
You know you want to fuck your nigga Doggy Dogg
Have you ever had your  tongue licked and shit?
While your nigga's in the county and you eating a dick
The position I'm fishing and wishing for
Is doing it Doggystyle, bitches blow


Oh I, oh I (oh yeah), oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh
(Doggystyle, doing it Doggystyle) I (do it Doggystyle)
Oh I, oh I (oh let me feel it), oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh
(I can see it, I can see it) I
Oh I, oh I, oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh (Doggystyle)
I (Doing it Doggystyle)
Oh I, oh I, oh-o-o-o-oh (doing it Doggystyle)
uh oh oh-o-oh I (oh yeah, I can see it)
Oh I, oh I (oh I want to feel it), oh-o-o-o-oh

Oh I, oh I (I can feel it) oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh I
(doing it Doggystyle, I want to taste it)


Snoop Doggy Dogg, won't you hit it from the back?
I like it like that
Doggystyle, Doggystyle
Won't you do it
Won't you do it Doggystyle
Won't you, one-two, won't you
Give me love  pussy
Won't you hit it from the back
Snoop Doggy Dogg
I heard you do it, do it all the time
I heard you doing it, doing it
Yeah
(Doing it Doggystyle)

Serving them hoes, but you don't love them hoes
I'll tell them some more
That you're doing it, doing it, Doggystyle
Oh yes
Baby

Baby
Do it Doggystyle for the nine-trey
With Dr. Dre
Yeah, doing it Doggystyle
Doing it, doing it, Doggystyle
Yeah, yeah

One lil, two lil, three lil G's
Hangin' on the dope spot slangin' they keys
Four lil, five lil, six lil cops
Leanin' in the cut, 'bout to get popped
Not, knowin' I'm scopin' on the roof
I got my red beam, better have ya bulletproof
Cause the light don't miss once I put it to ya dome
They got my homies jacked, now they reachin' for they chrome
Al Capone was a hero of mine
I've shot plenty niggas and cops, so fuck one time
Where they at? where they at? Oh, they in the back
So I gotsta take my time and make sure that my nine
Get him, got him, spot him, shoot him, he's shot
And now they call me Snoop Gotti
I'm like a fugitive, Harrison Ford
Slidin' in the Chevy now the shit's gettin' heavy
But you know I can't choke so I call my nigga Loc
Gotta find the hideaway and a big bag of smoke
Can't be fuckin' wit' my niggas while they makin' they dope
Cause if ya slippin', ya fallin' asleep on Death Row

Now some muthafucka done snitched on me
And the judge just sentenced me to do about a century
I'm mobbin' through the county main line
Back in 9500, just tryna handle mines
Spittin' game at my homies about the good ol' days
As we try to pass time, waitin' for the chains
To Chino, I see no reason to cry
When a nigga's still alive, right?
Five o'clock wake up, call roll, call Doggy Dogg
Be at the chow hall from there I roam the yard
Still representin' to the fullest, so you know what time it is
I shank a nigga in a minute, abiding rules of the pen
I adapt quick, don't take shit from no nigga
Hittin' pushups by the g's to get bigger
Eight months, I'm on swole, my mind's clearer
Everyday of my life I take a glimpse in the mirror
And guess what the fuck I'm startin' to see
I still regulate sleepin' in the penitentiary

It's like everywhere I look and everywhere I go
I'm hearing muthafuckas tryna steal my flow
But it ain't no thang, cause see my nigga Coolio
Put me up on the game when I stepped in the door
You know some of you niggas is so deceptive
Using my styles like a contraceptive
I hope you get burnt
Seems you haven't learnt
It's the knick-knack, patty-whack
I still got the biggest sack!
So put your gun away, run away, cause I'm back
Why? hit em up, get 'em up, spit 'em up
Now, tell me, what's going on?
It make me wanna holler, cause my dollars come in O-zones
Known for break off so take off your clothes
And quit trying to spit at my motherfuckin' hoes!
Speaking of hoes, I kick in the doors
Put my nuts on ya chin and the story goes

Why do bitch-ass niggas always talk shit
But don't when it's time to get wrecked, checked, and ripped?
I knew he was a hoe
Ready to turn a trick and I can tell from his lips that my dick would fit
I've split, gums
You didn't know dumb-da-ditty-dumb
And my shit do harm so run, ring the alarm
I thought you knew I'm looney like Tony Montana
In the mix running shit, oops and um
The smoothest, coolest, ruthless ya know
On a kamikaze mission (ooh, if I can be like Snoop)
Keep wishing, listen
With my balls in ya jaws, make room to put my dick in

Bi-itch
Yeah, now we gonna talk about these hoes for a minute (talk about these, let's talk about these hoes)

There's some hoes in this house
There's some hoes in this house
If you see 'em turn 'em out
There's some hoes in this ho-ow-ow

Bitch, why you looking at my dick?
Acting like you wanna blow a dick
Yeah, I know he know a bitch
Got my homie, and we all out to get laid
Seen this bitch on stage
Live, right, get it goin', don't stop
Panties drop, hit the floor
Don't act like you new to this hoe, I seen you before
Yeah, you don't remember me, cause I ain't have no loot
Now bitch, you tryna act cute
Pull up your skirt, do it like it's 'sposed be done
Ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
And after we get to ya, get with ya
Get through ya, stick dick to ya
Got my niggas in here motivated
Heated, gang related
, and it's like this
 bitch

This is for my homeboys
Let's show 'em how we get-get down
Show 'em how we -get down
Show 'em how we beat it to the beat of Tha Pound
Don't mind, it's just a pimp thang
Money with me every time, it's a grip thang
Short and simp' thang, get it like you want it
With the shake of Dogg on it
Go on do it like you want it
Baby lick it good-
Hip, big tits, shit's so thick
Baby flossin' that kitty, I ain't bullshittin' bitch
Go on, do what ya gotta do, baby lick it so tend'

Do ya see what I see? (hoes in this house)
All I see is pussy (see 'em, turn 'em out)
Do ya see what I see? (hoes in this house)
All I see is pussy (when you see 'em, turn 'em out)

Trip, now Daz, Luke, Kurupt, and Snoop
Come bangin' all the hoes in ya muthafuckin' group
It's a shame, how my game
Gon' get that pussy for me in a minute mane
There's hoes all over this place, I bumped a hoe from Atlanta
Named Nevanah, and I, ran a, plan up
That I had designed for another bitch named Savannah
Man I, had a lot of hoes in my lifespan
Even had a bitch from Iran named Jan
Not to mention Japan, I had a tight-eyed hoe with dough
Ya know? Fo' sho'
Now ya know I can bump 'em
So when they get out of line I won't hesitate to dump 'em
Cause I was taught not long ago
In order to gain a hoe, you gotta lose a hoe
That's why my stable, keeps me able
To buy nice cars, homes, and cables
Gangsta haters, a question for y'all
Why yo' bitch paws in my draws, holding on my balls?

You act like you don't do it
But you know ain't nuthin' to it
Don't play like you ain't been through it
Fit to blow dick like ain't nuthin' to it

One for the money, two for the hoes
Seen 'em all coming, they coming in rows
Bitches ain't shit, so I suppose
Your bitch is different, in different clothes
Hell nah she ain't, she's just an average hoe
That gives the average dick the average blow
Don't play, don't look at me that way
Don't switch, I know a bitch when I see a bitch
I know a hoe when I see a hoe
DPG done get blowed in some

Baby sit back, with your bad self
You ain't never ever had a piece of ass n'em
Once you get it butt-nekkid get to mackin' 'em
And she worked it on a nigga so
I get nasty, when you least expect
Get fine drunk hoes to get butt-nekkid
We don't be trippin' when walk inside the club
Find me a freak by the name of love
She love, wants a girl that like that dick
Plus like that clique and like freaky shit
You wonder why we bring these hoes
These types of clothes, so we suppose
Spit this game, once you think you know it
These freaky hoes is good to go

Do ya see what I see? (there's some hoes in this house)
All I see is pussy (if ya see 'em, turn 'em out)
Do ya see what I see? (there's some hoes in this house)
All I see is pussy (if ya see 'em, turn 'em out)

Man, this nigga right back in the club looking for some love
Standing at the bar with a pocket full of dubs
Paying some bitch, to make your dick get hard
Cause you's a muthafuckin' trick
I gets, niggas like you's on the regular
Send a hoe at ya, then look at ya
Right where I want ya at
Make sure you won't get no get-back
I learned from the best pimps in the game
I got hoes all over, my best hoe's Nova
I know ya tried to come over
And get at her, it really didn't matter
I had her, ready to cock back the hammer
And jam her, 9-double-M in your face
While you dance to the boogie of the bass
You chase hoes, I place hoes in they place, nigga

Now let me tell you som' right, a lot of niggas don't understand (nah they don't understand) how real pimps and real players handle their shit (they don't understand, know what I'm talkin' about)
Ya know, aye, me and my man, Dogg (tell 'em), you know we just puttin' hoes in they place, we pimpin' hoes (pimpin' hoes), laying hoes down (slamming Cadillac doors)
You know, a hoe is gonna be a hoe (hoe gon' be a hoe)
Some of y'all niggas don't understand that (yo' hoe be a hoe, let the hoe be a hoe fool)
So, so don't act like you don't do it (cause you know ain't nuttin' to it), cause you know ain't nuttin' to it
Just like we said, aye, hoes gon' be hoes (lay yo' bitch down, lay yo' bitch down, lay yo' bitch down, yuh, yuh), niggas gon' be niggas
We gon' get ours
Aye, y'all hoes gon' be mad

All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all

I sacked it up differently, in fact, specifically
Game so cold it left Jack Frost' nose froze
Now, you knows and I knows how the story goes
All the ladies say "hey" and the niggas say "ho"
While they sippin' on a 100 proof
All my niggas in the VIP boo, hollin' "woof"
Cause Snoop is back, back like Return of The Jedi
Nigga don't say shit, cause I
Already said I, be on the red-eye

Sometimes I feel lost like a runaway, read over the dire
Reap while I stay gettin Richard like Pryor
Need to put the gun away cause I got priors
It's hard to stay rollin when the world full of riders
Bullet tip on fire, flyin down sunset
Motivated to win, like I ain't won yet
Think shit over? Hell naw I ain't done yet
I L-B-see y'all prayin that a G fall
Tonight it's goin down like free fall
Chevy bouncin up and down like a fuckin see-saw
Trippin off hate, no Hee-Haw
All blacks locs on the loc actin like I don't see y'all
Doing that shit to demean Dogg
But when I bring it to you, you be like "What you mean Dogg?"
Then we go back and forth, like it's ping-pong
Knowin I should just ring ya bell, ding dong!
But that's one thing about this shit partner
Every move is so watched by these rich boxers
So why should I lose all my rich sponsors?
I'm gone then you suddenly hip-hoppin?
Sheeit, sip the gin then I'm in the wind
Pop a beam like a M&M
So strong yet a nigga thin
Rappers stay sayin Slim so Shady but ain't talkin Eminem
So fuck you, him, and him
I was gangbangin befo' a nigga entered in
No facade, I went from the yard
to a three-car garage to, instant menage it's
vintage, relentless, I mean this, I promise
No Suge, No Dre, I'da did this regardless
And thats what I'm supposed to think
Flinch at me like I'm supposed to blink
Motherfucker this Crip still, hard to swallow like a big pill
Pushin 40's still a big deal
Ponytail still swangin, hair still braided
Laker to a Clipper I won't be faded
Nigga! So buzz on that shit
Backflip back to plaque shit
Blue red white to black shit, but for the green
I send a whole motherfuckin team to clap shit
React to mack shit, problem, terrorist
Fuck this rap shit!


Shots fired
Suspect down
Request EMT immediately

Sometimes I feel lost like a runaway, read over the dire
Reap while I stay gettin Richard like Pryor
Need to put the gun away cause I got priors
It's hard to stay rollin when the world full of riders
Bullet tip on fire, flyin down sunset
Motivated to win, like I ain't won yet
Think shit over? Hell naw I ain't done yet
I L-B-see y'all prayin that a G fall
Tonight it's goin down like free fall
Chevy bouncin up and down like a fuckin see-saw
Trippin off hate, no Hee-Haw
All blacks locs on the loc actin like I don't see y'all
Doing that shit to demean Dogg
But when I bring it to you, you be like "What you mean Dogg?"
Then we go back and forth, like it's ping-pong
Knowin I should just ring ya bell, ding dong!
But that's one thing about this shit partner
Every move is so watched by these rich boxers
So why should I lose all my rich sponsors?
I'm gone then you suddenly hip-hoppin?
Sheeit, sip the gin then I'm in the wind
Pop a beam like a M&M
So strong yet a nigga thin
Rappers stay sayin Slim so Shady but ain't talkin Eminem
So fuck you, him, and him
I was gangbangin befo' a nigga entered in
No facade, I went from the yard
to a three-car garage to, instant menage it's
vintage, relentless, I mean this, I promise
No Suge, No Dre, I'da did this regardless
And thats what I'm supposed to think
Flinch at me like I'm supposed to blink
Motherfucker this Crip still, hard to swallow like a big pill
Pushin 40's still a big deal
Ponytail still swangin, hair still braided

Blue red white to black shit, but for the green

Pause pause pause


Look, I'm just a young nigga in the biz with mo' enemies than friends
Get no money goin out, but I got it comin in
And nah, I ain't a G but every day that's what I spend
I get paid to drop a verse, for 16 I need ten
End.. all the speculation
Them pre-conceived notions got me over-compensatin
And for you slow niggaz that mean not been concentratin
I'm shittin on these records while you rappers constipated
Uhh, it's get money, fuck haters
Me and hip-hop is like Chucks and blue laces
Me and Snoop Dogg is Sir Charles and King David
With Problem we all ballin like the '09 Lakers
Yeah, it's Terrance Martin on the track
And I'm that young nigga droppin crack back-to-back
My album on the way and I ain't worried 'bout the stats
But I could tell you how the streets gon' react
They gon' say

Woah woah woah woah woah woah woah
I got to snoop, so cold
Big Snoop (Battlecat, Snoop Dogg)


I hear the sercrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep


When you close your eyes and you go to sleep
That's when I ride, late night I be on the creep
I'mma get you before you get me
Them niggas that you hang with are so weak
You're talking shit about me
Turn around and you're the homie
Man that shit is phoney
Tried to set me up bro
But you were singing to my hoe




From a nigga to a dub
From a g to a scrub
I'm a vet on the set
I'mma show you what it was
Y'all flipping out, trippin' out
Cause I took a different route
6-2 rag, hell yeah come dippin' out
Beach city rider, 85'er, eastsider
Ain't none of y'all niggas live-er
I hear the bad shit that y'all talk
You want to catch me out of pocket but I can't get caught
I'mma show you what a bitch thought, a bitch taught
A nigga got played out and layed out in chalk
It's a cold game
It's like a rap riddle
Nine times out of ten a bitch was in the middle
Most neighborhoods started off cool
In the eighties it was Long Beach fool
With no seperation
Here's a toast to the real shit, the foundation
You know my game is amazing
I keep blazing
Eastside niggas is the craziest and the shadiest
Yeah dawg, tell 'em again
What you talking 'bout loc?
I got hell of a ends


Hell boss
Hoping that her smiling exes fall (ego hustling loopholes)
I'd always thought that you would've never have stabbed me everywhere


More rumours, more lies
More money, more time
I don't really give a fuck cause you all gon' shine
So you better get yours and quit worrying 'bout mine
I see it in your voice and I hear it in your eyes
So jealous, so envious
What a drag
Real talk loc, you ain't acting like a man
Your message is how blessed you is
I guess you is
Look at the mess you in




When you close your eyes and you go to sleep
That's when I ride, late night I be on the creep
I'mma get you before you get me
Them niggas that you hang with are so weak

Uugh, yeah
Snoop, Kells, once again
And this is for the non-believers
That seem to think that pimping is easy
Aiyyo Uncle Snoop
Let's go get these knuckleheads


Pop bottles (pop bottles)
Shake hands (shake hands)
Recognise (recognise) I'm the man
I try to tell 'em but they won't understand that pimping ain't easy
I got money (got money)
I got cars (got cars)
Still fucking with them hood superstars (superstars)
Spend a hundred grand over by the bar like pimping ain't easy


Well it ain't
All them faces in that laker paint
Casa by the lake
Make a little nigga faint
Balling is what I does
I ain't messing with you can'ts
I'm a can do negro
A real life California hero
About six zeros at the end of the number in my bank account
Nigga ain't ya mad at me
I'm so happy to see that you stopped your life to watch mine
Yeah you see it fool
Snoop's everywhere, Italy I'm heavy there
Did a show in Rome like hoe say you ain't never there
Talking 'bout you popping bottles
I don't see none
You made it rain where?
I don't see a wand
Go on get it off
That's what they like to hear
It's your money pimp
We don't fight it here
It's hard enough to be me
Not trying to be you is someting I got to see
Until then I'mma




This ain't a joke a loc made it look easy to you
I been through some shit
I made it easy for ya
Now you ain't got to do much, I pop at everybody
Go unwrap a bottle, share it with them busybodies
Tell 'em what she want to hear
How you would like to take her out of town and shopping here
And Snoopy is your homie
Nah nah girl he out of here
Yeah he just act like he don't know me when he all up in here
You a fool Jack
Though I don't condone faking for a bitch
Don't call it pimping when you're bringing home the bacon to this bitch
Go ahead and talk money
Talk, look at the chicks it brought
But know the deal you better flip her like a somersault
Snoopy never played the role for which he wasn't built for
Never called somebody friend that I wouldn't kill for
I do this balling cause I can not cause it's cool
I pop cause I'm the man
Now watch me and Kells




I got pimping in my veins
Pimping in my blood
Pimping in my swag
Pimping in my cup
Walking like a pimp when I walking through the club
Pause like a pimp so the hoes show me love
Pimp by day, pimp by night
Pimp haters make me keep my pimp game tight
See y'all type of fools make a nigga want thug
Like shots of patron make a nigga want fuck
But I ain't on that shit so I'mma throw my hands up
And keep it sexy pimping cause thats how I does
Uncle Snoop say Kells go hard or go home
Yo hating motherfuckers, I'm still here




To all my honeys in the club getting money with the thugs

Throw your bags in the back

And said that love was true
But you ain't never fake on me

Another G like me?

On a 3 day cruse
Walk with your man in the sand like ooh,

We can make it, let's just stay together
Come together, don't go

Forever, for life!

Now that we're living our life especial-ly

And every day we'll dress alike and always stay slick
To me, I see you as a gift
Incredible it's edible

Watch your mouth never speak on what you not know
I'm from the west coast I turn his face into a pothole
15 deep niggas creepin' in the Tahoe
Let's see you act macho when I pull the burner on ya
Sideways like a taco
Rap niggas we all talk like a Raldo
Trunk full of cargo
Dry like Barstow
Arsenal run up on 'em
Get up on 'em
Drill 'em with the clips
Niggas gon' respect mine
I run this whole shit
Crip rag in my pocket
Three eighty on my hip
But back to this hip hop
Who next on the list
Gangstas don't kiss we get old and die rich
I smoke till I'm sleep
Crush these niggas with my fist
Your daddy was a coward you's a son of a bitch
So back to the glock with the infra-blue clip
We hit licks and gang bang
You on some T-Pain shit
Chop the pop and 20 crip
Watch the flames hit his whip
Then I'm back to the block shit
Rock shit, hot shit
Hit 'em in the chest
Doggy run up in his pockets
Misrepresenting sock him in his eye socket
I sat back and let you little niggas make your profits
Nonsense, I'm watching, hoes out of pocket
You heard what they say
Don't block it till you knock it
You stole my whole style
I'm 'bout to take you fools hostage
Brrrah, bhrrrrah
From the looks to the hooks
I'm looking at these new niggas flippin' through my book
There's only one king
Is you a pawn or a rook?
I got hand machine guns and soldiers on foot
So beef with me it's none
Nigga done south huh
I throw a bullet at ya who gon catch it nigga duck
Then send them goons at ya
Turn your weapons into dust
You against me it's like trying to fight a bus
I'm at the BET Awards sitting in disgust
It's still a (G Thang) but yet they wanna be us
They wanna be Daz
They wanna be Kurupt
Cash on delivery money up front
Yeah
Bubble kush out a purple blunt
Who's the best nigga circle one
Snoop Dogg
I'm large in the streets
My arms and my feets knee deep in the game
I'm the best on the beat
Let you little niggas speak
And run for a treat
Motherfuckin' geeks
All y'all niggas owe me until you rest in peace
And that's our D.P.G. motherfucka


That's real shit man
How the fuck y'all gon' keep having these award shows out here on the west coast
But ain't no mutherfuckas from the west coast winning no awards, nigga?
It's like that, it's just like that

We showed you niggas how to do this shit
Bitch ass nigga.
Want some, get some.
Bad enough, take some

From the hood, to the valley, from yards, to the alleys
"Wonderland" in demand and the man is "Malice"
O.G.'s blow trees, gold keys to the palace
Gangbang on 'caine maintain for the challenge
and shank ya, bank ya, levitate ya, spray ya
Butch (Cassidy!) Come with some gangster flavor


On my block, I handle my deep business every day
I hustle, on the streets I do it the old fashioned way
I roll out, with some girls that's from the hood
They love me, that's understood
And we burn trees that's so good, damn, we, should
Daily, I stay G'd up with my khakis and my 'gars
Burn, then I pick up my two dogs and bend the curb
That's gangsta, gotta grab a fresh  bud
Now I bend it up like a thug
And my Chrysler on two dubs, plus, G'd, up
I keep it gangsta fo' sho', because it's all that I know
The only way that I roll, the only way that I'll go I'm so


SO gangsta, I'm so, SO gangsta
So gangsta - SO gangsta, we are, I'm sooooooo
SO gangsta, so gangsta, SO gangsta
So gangsta, SO gangsta, bye bye


Itchy gitchy ga ga, the shit that get you hotter
So you won't have to bother or come back yeah baby father
Best save for dada, unbutton your collar
Mix the shit yup it's "Tha Doggfather"
Six-deuce Impala, hip-hop to holler
Chipped blocked and locked, hits with rottweilers
Stand out, and van out the week
I bang out, and hang out the streets
Push the line of a capo, a don
Whick-whack niggaz did black folks so wrong
Peep that out
Eastside Long Beach, grip that out
Two times on mine; see I'm a vet on the set
Steppin my step, where my weapon is kept
C-rag in my pocket yeah it's still on my left
I'ma smoke 'til my motherfuckin last breath
I'm so gangsta




Are you gangster? They all know
Hot doe, breaks down do's and kill at shows
Wanksta - never though
Let it go, call up hoes, I got the indo
Boooooom, watch the intellect lose her fear
Street shit they can't come near
Let 'em all know that I'm here, no more fears

Dogghouse
Gimme some of that g shit goldie loc
Yeah, that's what I'm talkin 'bout
Yeah, check this out y'all, uh huh huh

We got Snoop Dogg in the house tonight, with the homeboy tray-deee

What you say, huh? (we do this like everyday)

Did ya get the dank, did ya get the dank?
Yeah I got the dank, you got the gas in the tank?
V.I.p. status, don't need an apparatus
'cause the niggas I fuck with, they all about the cabbage
Down in yellobrick road my destination, the dogghouse
Toastin remys, fillin' jimmies, we goin all out
Lookin for the wizard, creepin through the fog
Got some bad ass bitches, headed to the player's ball
They gon be strippin and wigglin ass
Hope you brought your playa pass
Tray-deee, goldie half dead, the twins blaze sacks
Bigger than big everyday in l.a.
4 tay representin for the whole damn yae, beeyotch

Dogghouse, turnin it out, and if you ain't dope you gots to get
The fuck out, that's on the o g d p, (say what)
And that's how it is when you fuckin with me

Don't matter how you come, use all angles
Ties become tangled when the cutthroat strangles
My hookup, long rangers
Better float like a nationwide sky pager
Them hoes save us, talk about bein playas
On the real we can deal with you playa haters
We hit the spot, every city got a block
What you makin when you take it to a different type of level that it pops
Know the dogg keep the hip rocks, steady bangin
Hoes steady sangin from the gang that we claimin
Yo, it's waniac, the maniac, trip loc won't you spit that rap

Park my shit and jump out, I'm at the homies spot
To see if he floatin with me up to the dogghouse
Hit the weed he lightin, outside little niggas is fightin
This bomb, I'm likin
Holla at my folks I know up in the complex
Nigga ready to ride as soon as he get dressed
Now we ready to roll, hit the store, then the carpool lane
Once again it's on, big chiefin
Remind me of the noisiest place
Ladies all over the place, and niggas super laced
How we like it, saggin in my 5 0 1
Killin my lungs, keepin these homies and bitches on one

Man I got warrants, bad tax, still sayin fuck it
Headed up to dogghouse swervin in a bucket
Puffin on some bomb from my comrade blue
And got my little bitch catch a contact too
House shoes with the blue khaki suit and my locs on
Swoopin to some soopafly, gettin my smoke on
Nigga goldie loc got the heat on roast it
4 tay on the way plus the twins is posted
Bout to set it off bet it's off the hook
Straight crooks, gettin money off the books
Makin nothin but that gangsta shit that niggas lovin
Thuggin at the house party, fuck goin clubbin

Let me hear you say pimps, banks, hustlers
Let's all get the money then murder these motherfuckers
Cocksuckers, they can't stop us
Now put up your choppers, just in case they rollin with them coppers
I shut em down, doggpound for them bitches
I be seein you with snitches everytime I'm hittin switches
Ice skatin over dicthes
I'm true to the game, plus I'm out to get them riches
I be mobbin down the road tryin to bag up my bags
I'm saggin so hard I'm tearin up the back of my khakis
I'm tryin to reach my dogg dirty red
But this hoe won't let me know, which way to go
I'm movin slow
My chucks only come with a hundred miles of walkin
Hundred miles of runnin smellin funny and I'm gunnin nigga
Doggpound gangsta crip for life
And we gon party in this motherfucker all damn night

Snoopy, is what they say as if they knew me
Groupies on my head like a kooflee, my nigga kid cudi,
That's my little buddy,
Call some hoe's up and get some cudi cudi,
What yo life like, mine is kinda tight,
A long way from hustlin, a china white,
My people love, the fans love me I'm all go,
If you ain't showin love then what did you call for,
I don't need it in my life, my kids pay the price,
So alike and in need of my wife, smoke till I'm gone,
Dog on the throne I'm world-wide known and a boss in the zone,
I get it how I get it cause I can, I earn the spot,
You see the plans, I'm just fuckin with my fans,
I turned out to be a better man, important for life,
You understand while I'm puffin on this gram


Everything I'm havin, no there ain't necessity,
Though I'm shining, keep on grinding what you see ain't all of me,
Though I keep them hoe's, don't love them hoe's,
The code in which I roll, it's so simple what I need,
I keep my Fam and I can't forget that tree,
Nah nah nah nah nah nah,
I can't forget that tree,
Nah nah nah nah nah nah,
I can't forget that tree,
Nah nah nah nah nah nah,
I can't forget that tree,
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah


I got my fam dog, look at my niggas,
Got little money dogg but I ain't tripping,
Most days I'm faded, feeling ex-rated,
Steady wanting freaky hoes, then I want a lady,
Holdin' the fam down and the clothes on me,
The people who were there, stupid sucka left me lonely,
Phony, when you see me nigga, don't approach me,
Made it to the top baby, that's on me,
Cops trying to claim that they made me,
I want you to feel another real for gaizing,
I keep it one hundred, never frontin, don't need me,
I'm in the zone, no place for pussy my nigga,
Cool yo that niggas don't know, loco how a nigga like me postpone,
The one fans loved, who was always approachable yo,
And I rep the double O, smoking, eating cherrios




Can't forget it, they made me who I am, a king,
And I'm still on the scene you gotta love it, all out in public,
The people want to touch it, I need a blunt with the stuffin',
Nigga, it's nuthin for me to chill out and post up at the house,
With Madden on the screen and smash on the homies,
Hollywood nice now,
Everyone want me and on the blogs they talk shit like they know me,
Fool, I'll take you niggas to school, "How to get rich and stay cool",
Snoopy D O Dub show you homie, even with the critics and feds on me,
I was tappin all the Choanies,
Dog, but my folks call me snoopy, boss dogg nigga sue me,
Pony tail swinging as I lay in the jacuzzi,
Love of my life while I'm puffing on the good weed




Snoop dogg in the house tonight blowing that laker crip that I know you like, right?
Kid Cudi, my nephew, blaze that shit right now Would you? Would you? Right?

Let me take you to the land of wonder, we can wander
undercover, secret lovers, ay heyyy ("And ohh you're gonna love me")
("You're gonna wanna hug me, and") squeeze, squeeze, squeeze me


Hmm, and I ain't never felt like this
I ain't never met a girl with the right mix
Green eyes, light-skinned with some nice tits
It took a minute just to write this
I'm the Boss Dogg baby! I'ma die rich
So let the money talk for me, fuck the nonsense
Hold me down, be my ride or die bitch
We fuck then we fight, we fight then we fuck
I'ma beat it up tonight like Kimbo Slice
Come live the proper life, no I ain't the shoppin type
I might take you out to eat, we can grab a bite
Now let me grab my bike and roll yo' ass through Crescent Heights
Up in Hollywood, step into the limelight
and hit this bubble kush, let me get your mind right
This is "Wonderland," let your mind take flight
We gotta hurry up, I'm only here for one night




This next girl Bird, she from the suburbs
and live by herself, like cars and nice furs
and loves hip-hop - The Neptunes and Murs
But I'm her favorite rapper, my biggest fan is her
I like her skin tone, and how her figure curves
We smoke mad kush and drink until our vision blur
And then I pat her down, like she gettin searched
I fuck her with my chain on, she pulls on my shirt
like nigga don't stop, until the pussy squirt
I hit it twice and bone out, she went back to work
This happens all the time, I gotta go rehearse
for my next show, I tour on May 1st
Get yo' mind right, and this may work
You know love is pain, and havin faith hurts
You rollin with the best, so grab your heels and purse
and welcome to "Wonderland" the best place on Earth
Uhh, you gon' love me!

("And ohh you're gonna love me")
("You're gonna wanna hug me, and") squeeze, squeeze, squeeze me

Ahh Snoopadelic boppers!

Take it back to the afros and the naturals
Cape cutter picks we slips into the back
I'm O.G. my nigga for real though
Straight up off that east side top of the hill yo
I'm looking at the overview
Thinking bout 86 damn I was overdue
Walking in the hood making mix tapes trying to walk up out the hood
While I'm chucking at the hood nigga talk about the hood
That I came from it raised me real Crip crazy
 oops a daisy
Demon or a heathen scheming while I'm dreaming
Screaming to get even seeing is believing
And don't you forget that
Get it to you get back hit that kick back
Three flies one a way
Reminisce about the things that my grandmama use to say
Stay in your own lane stay on your own and quick trying to be grown
Day turn to night and play turn to fight
Yeah I guess my granny was right

Reflections of the way life used to be
It's all right

I like them girls from Ladera Heights or the girls on Hills
I take a trip up the World On Wheels and get in a fight
Make it back to my ride
Pop shots at some suckers disrespecting the side
My big homie my cuzzo schoolyard bozo
Slid me away just to get me away
I'm just a Long Beach nigga outside of my hood
I'm banging riding but doing it good
When I get locked down there ain't hiding and wondering
As soon as I hit the County I'm up in 48 hundred
With the dealers the killers the
The best from the west and the beast from the east
Yeah I'm acting a fool
I'm getting my degree from gladiator school
I chose this life cause I knows this life
Sell a little crack and my flows is tight
I'm clear on my choice and what's cold is
I can still hear my grandma's voice
She say day turn to night and play turn to fight
Yeah I guess my granny was right

Reflections of the way life used to be
It's all right

If you get caught then you don't walk cause you don't talk
And these was the rules squeeze on these fools
I came up in a different era homie
Where the G's is the G's and the little wannabe's really want it
Wanna be like cause the C life make you wanna G like
Now who you wanna be like
That fool on the TV screen
Or the homie on the corner getting major cream
In the Cadillac beating like Battle Cat
A nigga with money don't know how to act
Smoke til your eyes get cataracts
All money nonsense yeah none of that
Quarter sack run it back
Hold him back lock him up bag him up front him that
If a trick jump the track do you want your money back
Lil bitch was a bunny rat
Watch for the funny hat
Cause it's gonna come
And my granny said it's no fun
She say day turn to night and play turn to fight
Yeah I guess my granny was right

Reflections of the way life used to be
It's all right

Bank accounts big cars
Living good like a movie star
My mama house ain't in the hood no more
I moved her out to San Luis Obispo
But it's a trip though cause I'm a 20 Crip though
I gotta lay low my homies wanna do low
I got two strikes and I'm a get my third
These niggas snitching on me they think I'm selling birds
So when I'm in the streets I'm quick on my feet
See talk is cheap so I stay quick on my heat
You niggas bad well Dogg is badder
Rat-a-tatter make you niggas scatter
I went shotta your boy want me now
Went to the station that nigga straight point me out
So I'm a lay away and spray away and spray away
Cause at this time I think it's best I just stay away

They say I am a fool cause I like to do my thing my own way
I gotta couple strikes against me one more and I'm on my way
I ain't got time to hang around the hood like I used to do I gotta get my bread
Keep my head it's either go to jail or get this money instead

Separate elevate
Concentrate dominate and innovate
Try to be fly as me
And every other homie tell them lie to me
I need a deal I need some stones
I need some beats Dogg I need a loan
Help me out throw me some cash
If I got you got it and you ain't got to ask
But on the real or is it lately
A lot of homies they tried to implicate me
They say I am changed is it the fame
If I throw it to you then charge it to the game
Money fold overload
In the hood another episode
Man I'm getting old the game cold
Yeah I'm from the Dub but that ain't how I roll

They say I am a fool cause I like to do my thing my own way
I gotta couple strikes against me one more and I'm on my way
I ain't got time to hang around the hood like I used to do I gotta get my bread
Keep my head it's either go to jail or get this money instead

I wonder wonder wonder what it do
I wonder wonder wonder what it do
I wonder wonder wonder what it do

My Maze is Frankie Beverly
Heavily influenced I do it like you can't
I'm the weed to the Zag with the bag and a drink
Get live that's five on the black hand side
Now try to stay fly with a piece of pie
I heard fish don't burn in the kitchen
The baby gangstas they get in the hood and on a mission

And when things go wrong
Her faith is strong
I know that she'll never doubt me

Cracky smacky dippy whippy habitual potential
Strip for your credentials
Mental unessential, shit's official like a referee with a whistle
Nah my nigga shit's official, like a Jihad, Muslim with a missile

Fuck around and get molly whopped in here,
Better not attract no cops

Who want what I got in stock?

Heavy weights exhale, 5 star hotels

Trying to increase my profit quick

My mama told me never ever trust one, bust one and break ‘em
Be about your paper nigger take it
Everyday’s a hustle, got these haters at my neck
Suckers tryna get a check
Boss dogg does it, hoes wanna call what it wasn’t
Tryna kiss a nigger all in public, bitch, is you crazy?
I preach pimping not pussy, shit I heard it all before
I ain’t no motherfucking rookie
I’m a long beach, grown twenty? playa ’bout his g’s
I ain’t tripping off these walls
You know these rats is after cheese
Messing with my focus, the locust on his grind
They be focus on his dick and keep your focus off my time
Stay in the lane that I made for you to chill
Until then it’s been real, I gotta handle business
And you I know we’re in it, see tripping gets you nowhere
Cause bitch I’m on that


I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch all on me
Trippin’ and calling my phone, always lying
I don’t need no bitch, bitch constantly checking on me
Bitch don’t even try it
I’m out here grinding, that's why
I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch….


We used to rock to the rhythm that didn’t stop
Now you telling me I need to be getting out and go find me a bitch
Cause it’s over and through
But why do I need a bitch when I got you
I don’t mean it like it sounds, but we used to be a team
Yo, we used to have a dream yo, we used to put our things together
Now it’s dividing, hiding, bottled up negative feelings inside
These bitches, they come a dime a dozen
F-ck one that once sucked my dick and find another (bitches)
I don’t need ‘em, don’t buy ‘em nothing to drink, I don’t feed them (bitches)
Never mind them, I stay in front, I used to chase behind them
No, I don’t wine and dine them (bitches)


I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch all on me
Trippin’ and calling my phone, always lying
I don’t need no bitch, bitch constantly checking on me
Bitch don’t even try it
I’m out here grinding, that's why
I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch….


Hell no, I don’t need one
And all that talking and fussing bitch you can miss me
I put these size twelves down on a 10 speed
Before I let a bitch get the best of me
I don’t need no bitch bitch bitch
The recipe for danger, phone checking, the recipe for anger
I’m from a gang but I don’t wanna bang ya
And I can tell how you tell all your friends about my Benz and my ears? bitch
Really I’m the perfect stranger, which turned you to the perfect stalker
Body like miss parker, maybe get little darker
But I’ma have to pass on that ass you was too much in the first place
Never understood when it was work day
And then she all up on your boy in the worst way
You need to detox, bitch see Dr. Dre
Cause crazy ain’t gonna get it, and tripping get you nowhere
Cause bitch I’m on that, bitch I’m on that


I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch all on me
Trippin’ and calling my phone, always lying
I don’t need no bitch, bitch constantly checking on me
Bitch don’t even try it
I’m out here grinding, that's why
I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch….

You need to quit talking crazy
I don’t need no bitch
You need to quit talking crazy

Hand full of aces trumped up dump trunk white wall paces
Drink til you drop motherfucker cop
Old English 800 on the block
Way before St. Ide's came to the spot
Niggas used to hang out and do the pop lock
And if we got into some shit we never pop shots
We'd squab scrap whatever it was
And live to talk about it and we get old cause
And keep a pack of zig zags for that good old bud
We do a house party what the fuck is a club
And the ese's they sold most of the drugs
La familia hell and
We get money yeah and we do low ride
Represent it and talk nope no not I
That's the code in every hood that you roam
Fastest way to catch a hot slug in your dome
O.G. the place that I call home
Black Lac like that and it's sitting on chrome
Plaque in back strap in Lac
Antennas wake you up for a rat trying to set a new trap
Swinging the track dripping curl juice on your back
Breaking hearts like Roger and Zapp motherfucker


Back in the day it was cheaper to keep her
Hang out with your friends and smoking the reefer
Pound for pound we were the baddest in town
You just had to get up for the get down
Some say we the next generation
But we lack education


 drinking mad dog 20/20
Silver satin blue Kool Aid sagging in my Dickies
I got my loccs on sailing through my neighborhood
Catch you slipping on them bricks it ain't all good
Front door kicker Glock spitter
Black and gold flag across my face when I get you
3 wheeler tipping turning up the Alpine
 while I listen to the grapevine
 blue Crips all by the front door
East side rip riding gang banging all I know
Heart break hotel hush puppy neck kicker
I grew up on that crazy one five nigga
If you locc from my block then hop something
And I ain't talking bout no peel nigga block hunting
Blue corduroys while I'm talking on my brick phone
14 years old had to bring the shit home
My uncle Sugar Bear showed me how to bag it up
Look at the block now nigga it's sewed up
I ain't playing with you old grand pubas
Peace out Rolando ran things with no
Now take a picture of this 8 ball sipper
Look down at my shoes blue strings nigga
Goldie Loc will keep this motherfucker crack-a-lackin
The only thing I wanna hear is gang bang rapping


Some say we the next generation
But we lack education
Hanging with the crew of devastation
Yeah but we one nation mama
Tally-ho and away we go
See you next week with a brand new show
When you funk around here ain't nothing consensual
You know I funk so hard you gonna need your parent's credential
Now I'm in the street cause I lost my sheep
But now I know where to find that
Now how cool is cold when you're trying to compete
Standing next to me son you better take a seat
Can't none of you cut throats funk like me
You better check with Snoop Dogg and get your pedigree
Why oh why do I think like that
If I am with the dog you must be a cat
Now tally-ho and away we go
See you next week with a brand new show
I want the bomb I want that O.G. back
There's a party going on in my head
While I think about the blood that we shed
Then party uh when the player play
There's a party going on up in here

Back in the day it was cheaper to keep her
Hang out with your friends and smoking the reefer
Pound for pound we were the baddest in town
You just had to get up for the get down
Some say we the next generation
But we lack education
Hanging with the crew of devastation
Yeah but we one nation mama
Hanging with the Snoopatronics bobba

I love it, love it, love it, love it
Southern surfer Cali


Rollin' down Fairfax
Just left the Nico, bust a left turn on Pico
Gotta see the Bishop, he got me some gator shoes
I'm rollin' to Hollywood, I'm doing the house of blues
About 9 o clock stop by the record shop
And get that new Snoop Dogg, now we bouncing ball
Life is a mystery, my life is like history
Stop by my dispensary
Give me some kush and pusha
Put it in the trunk, smelling like some skunk
But it's all legal in LA
Everybody taking a hit from the politicians
Athletes and even the teachers
My dentist even hit it, Dr Beecher
He say "Snoop Dogg I really wanna meet ya"
Yeah, I love showing you now
First things first, my nig' you better know where you at
You in


LA, Sunset boulevard, Pacific Highway
Out to the walk of stars now you in Cali
Don't go 'less you go hard
Go 'less you go hard

Hollywood, downtime and back
Life is always good
It's not an act we so fresh, so hood
You knew that it never would
Knew that it never would

I'm not down with the Republican Party
Or the Democratic Party
I represent the Gangsta Party
The Gangsta Party?
Yes, sir

I ain't no gang bang rookie, let that thang bang fully
I'm a boss out here on the West
Killa Coast is my home, rich rollin' on my throne
With my blue bandana on my neck

Girl, come fuck with Snoop
Sign up on my team, there's a little room left
Girl, you heard all my songs
Steady long, steady wrong, don't get yo' ass left

You wanna be in the league, well, tell 'em who sent ya

Hoes lovin' me, you niggers wanna be
Snoop, even Bloods fuck with cuz
I hit the club, they all showin' me love
They like, "Snoop Dogg"

"Can I get yo' autograph?
What's up with that D.P.G., Doggystyle and Aftermath?"
I just laugh while I'm twistin' up another zag
Bad bitches kissin' in the tub, takin' bubble baths

I ain't no gang bang rookie, police tryin' to book me
I'ma modern day Tookie on the set
I got the whole party poppin', see you hater niggers
Jockin' all these ice cold diamonds on my chest

They see my whole team thuggin'
Now they mean muggin' but that don't mean nothin'
'Cause if it's a problem I pull the problem solver
Call it 38 revolver, put an end to all this drama

I'm top dollar with the gold flea collar
Get them girls, get them dollars, get them zeroes, get them commas
Yeah, it's time to get this change, guess I'm like Obama

I ain't no gang bang rookie, y'all just tryin' to overlook me
Long Beach, Eastside when I ride, Skinny side get real low
And I tell them I got violent acts, son, I be shoppin' on the set

Let a bitch hit me up for some brain blow
If nigger's didn't know, I'm 'bout cake though
D.P.G., Young Pilot fuck with Snoop

O.G. what a young man
15, got hated like a grown man
Weed money, that's me, who I fuck with

And the top back, Doggystyle, bangin' out, motherfuckin'
Snoop, two-one, what it do?

Diamonds on my neck, shinin' like a chandelier like

Damn, I can't believe I'm in the club with big Snoop
Young Pilot

Snoop, are you still basically a gangster?
That's a figure of speech but you know, I like usin' that word
Is it G-A-N-G-S-T-E-R or G-A-N-G-S-T-A?

Can you be my doctor?
Can you fix me up?
Can you wipe me down?
So I can lick you up
Make you give it up, Give it up
Til you say my name
Like a jersey, jersey

Be my head coach
So you can put me in
And never take me off
Til you can taste the win
Do it again and again
Til you say my name
And by the way I'm so glad that you came

Tell me baby are you wet (wet, wet, wet, wet, wet)

She's hot on a rainy day
Don't drown
Call me up

Lick your feet and kiss your mouth
Swisha sweet, I got you out
There's only one way we can stop the drought
Come with me take a trip down south
I can tell she's thirsty
I'm in the hole like a birdie
What you wanna do tonight
It's still early
Wanna get spewed tonight
She's all sturdy
I'm in between your lips
Like a cigarette
She wanna quit
But she wanna make it, make it, make it wet

I'm gonna get you wet
Tell tell me baby are you wet
I just wanna get you wet wet

Drip, drip, drip, drip, for me mami
Can you drip, drip, drip,
Drip drip, drip, drip for me mami

So I can give it to you rough
Like a first draft
Would you like a paper plane
You know 'bout that paper babe
But fuck them dollar bills
Girl make it rain
holiday Inn, come
Meet me on the 8th floor
Damn it feels good but I feel bad for them maids though
But when I slip inside I turn girls into slip n slide
It's a flood in your heart love
Girl let me pop up in your hot tub
Every night every day
Sippin' on a different drink
Different chicks different days
I do it different ways
Where you going
What'd you say
I want her river flowing to another lake
Another ocean another ocean
On the beach on the beach
I'm bout to take a swim
Let let me dip my feet and get wet

I wanna get you wet
Tell tell me baby are you wet
I just wanna get you wet wet wet

Drip, drip, drip, drip, for me mami
Can you drip, drip, drip,
Drip drip, drip, drip for me mami

I can be yo' best friend; let me stick it in


And not just the tip
I wanna give you all of it
She's a model, all tall and shit
I'm Too $hort, but I ain't got a small dick
 Just ask around
I fucked a lot of hoes in this town
I get down, I come long and wide
And when I pull it out they all wanna ride
The sun's comin up, we started at 4
I spit so much game it's hard to absorb
And everything you believe she hates
Like pimpin, she appreciates
Cause my women, knows to understand the game
It's all about the money, give a fuck about the fame
You never get a chance to go out with me
If you a broke bitch, and you not a real freak




You came with your friend but she fat as fuck
And nann one of my homies wanna fuck, and now she wanna front
From the get-go I figured this is how it gon' be
Tell that little punk bitch that you ride with me
Don't stop, fo' hop
Hollywood Hills back to Too $hort's spot
You wanna roll let's get ghost and jet
I wanna see if I can make you wet
Cause you need it, let me beat it
Your lil' fat friend, actin conceited
Sittin in the corner; leave her, the bitch is a loner
Dancin, givin me a boner (ooh)

Me and you boo, we need to roll on out
You sit here, in the bed where
I need to just wanna put the head in, biatch!




She wanna be my B-F-F
I'm on a time limit, got no time left
See I'm a mathematician, you can add the bed
Subtract your clothes then divide your legs
When it all equals out you can moan in bed
She gave me the P, gave her the D instead
See you a hot mess with that booty and thang thang
Swangin in the club when you drinkin that drink drink
Smoke in the air, chillin all in the zone
Fuck me on the dance floor with my clothes on
Too $hort, Snoop Dogg! Uhh, imagine that
She threw me the pussy, I threw the dick right back
See I just wanna hit it and stick it in
Cause I don't wanna be yo' boyfriend
And you don't wanna be my girlfriend
I touch her once, so I'ma say it again

Top selector number one Big Snoop D-O-double-G, ya!
Come again, bo, bo!
There's somethin 'bout this night
Somethin 'bout this light, yahhhhh


Illa dilla, I'ma killer
Snoopy Dogg with the Gorillaz
Layin low, on the flo'
My hands up high, I'm full of 'dro
Girlies tryin to kiss me slow
I'm leanin like a sixty-fo'
This life I live's incredible
These trees I breeze are medical
Take a look, in my eyes
Hold on tight, enjoy the ride
If you don't feel good then you out of place
My universe, is outer space
My look, my style, my Prada case
Lil' daddy get out our face
Trip this, sip this, hit that, now sit on back
And let Dogg go and get on that
Party people you invited


Have you ever tried it somethin like this night
I can try to smoke wit'chu, somethin like this night
Have you ever tried it somethin like this night
I can try to smoke wit'chu, somethin like this night
Somethin like this night, somethin like this night
Somethin like this night, somethin like this night


What a night to get involved
Everybody have a pause
Celebrate and fill your cup
Drink until you get enough
How you feel, I got that feelin
Disco lights hang from the ceiling
Ain't nobody on the wall
Pop it, drop it, let that fall
Hey DJ, play my song
Step back, let it bang all night long
I need your attention, no hopin or wishin
Come in in high-definition
Said I do, right that I do
Get up and get money, yep that I do
Rode it, ride it, lick it
Bite it, roll it, ride it
Party people you invited



 Party people you invited


Somethin like this night, somethin like this
Somethin like this night, somethin like this night

You know Snoopy a little while back
I had one of those, carpal tunnel operations
And the doctor said "I want you to go home and
SHUT UP (mm) for four months," annnd that's kinda tough
I said "I'll try it," but while I was there
I wrote this song


Too many pain pills, too much pot
Tryin to be somethin that I'm not - Superman! Superman
Tryin to do more than I can, I got a little outta hand
I ain't Superman - know what I'm talkin 'bout?


I blew my throat and I blew my tour
I wound up sippin on soup d'jour - I wasn't Superman
Oh no, I wasn't Superman
I'm tryin to do more than I can, I got a little outta hand
I wasn't Superman


I hear ya! Mickey play with us



Yeah, play that Mickey, go ahead!
Play it Willie!
Yeah go ahead Willie


Well the doctor said son it's a cryin shame
But you ain't Clark Kent and I ain't Lois Lane
You ain't Superman; you ain't Superman
Tryin to do more than you can, you got a little outta hand
You ain't Superman - whaddya think Snoop?


Well when I die, put it on my stone
God said Snoop you take your bad ass home you wasn't Superman
Ha ha ha, no, I wasn't Superman
I'm tryin to do more than I can, I got a little outta hand
I wasn't Superman (I hear ya!)


Tryin to do more than I can, I got a little outta hand
I ain't Superman


Yeahhh!

And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I’m about to hit the ground


Sippin’ yac while I elevate my mind state
Hand by the burner in case a nigga try to violate
Never going down, stay rising like Andre
Cause my corner back every thing the Don say
Long Beach, yeah I yell it out in every song
Err’y day, err’y night till I’m carried home
Forever known, big ballin’, try it in the city
Then yelling out swish way before it in the net
And I ain't knocking a niggas hustle, it’s all a game
And when they mention the best, will they call your name?
There's only winners and losers, ain't no in between
You either hit the hall of fame or you fall to shame
And you ain't got to wonder where my place at
pepsi blue rags sorta poppin, bitch taste that
One hit of the bong will blow ya face back
LMFAO to the bank, boy, ASAP


And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I’m about to hit the ground


I do it cause I feel it
Live it like I’m talkin’
Flow so straight but wont a nigga try and ?
I’m so high, yeah the weed, I’m still sparking it
My bitch bad and my diamonds still sparkling
Got the competition shaking like Parkinsons
Breads in the bag, call it good marketing
Life’s a bitch but I don’t cartigan?
That's what a word to the third letter
Shots, shots, shots to me and my cheddar
Run these emcee’s I’m tougher than leather
Vietnemese eyes tighter than ever
Fuck with the Dogg I’m biting whomever
Cause I don came from a long path
Only God knows how long the Dogg has
Cause like time we all pass
So if you ever taste success, just pray it’s from a tall glass


And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I’m about to hit the ground


I sold my soul to the devil that's a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal
This game you could never win
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me misery
Get away from me loneliness
Get away from me fake bitches, I can’t take the phoniness
Get away from me wack tracks
I can only make only hits
I’m an only child lost in the World
Where did the lonely kids go when the bell ring
Its Feeling like hell rings
Bringing me back down
Checking my background
Its ironic whats happening
Imagine if I didn’t have the ends
I wouldn't have so many imaginary friends
I’m spaced out Dog, I be on that Moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moon walk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophmore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And we ain’t finna change, so we won’t agree again
till then I’ll be pouring out my soul
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed


And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
feeling like my life froze
I’m about to hit the ground

(I was raised in the hood)
Eastside Long Beach to be exact
(I was raised in the hood)
Where the grass is greener and the crips are much meaner
(We got ya, back, I was raised in the hood)
I'll never turn my back on the hood
(I was raised in the hood)
Yeah you can take me out the hood
But you can't take the hood up outta me


Raised by the gangstas, the generals, the thieves, the twins
Yeah I'm stealing niggas, please what you know bout that
I do it everytime, told em 1800 had em mixing it with lime (oh weee)
My life is like a movie, I was thuggin in the beach when I lit my first doobie
In the same city where I got my first piece of coochie
Where I sold my first dime, and I held my first uzi
Bitch, choose me, cause I'm going to the top
Rap or the rock, them hoes say I'm on bitch
Whenever will it stop
I was poppin' like it's on, slamming Chevy's up the block
East up, what it do though
Now I ride 2-door, the Porsche looking mean
Hella far from broke, the 40 won't choke plus a niggas still elope
Only cause I was raised in the hood


I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)
I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)
We got ya back
I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)
I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)
We got ya back


Raised by the monsters the criminals
The G's, it was ? the niggas on the east
What you know bout that?
Snoopy in his prime, I'm a boss
I catch a nigga slippin' like moss
Ride with the realest , I've been on it since a young'n
It's 200 bitches in the function
Looking cool, you know it bitchy I'm rollin'
And I aint worried bout them niggas we patrolling the hood and the city
Rollin on that dilly
2 milly, 2 Bugatti's, call em Rozay and Diddy
Heart of the set, Homie I'm a vet
Lil nigga, keep ya clothes, ask around,
I'm a rep, East up, what it do though
Hoes spillin' Nuvo, Doggy on his tip
I threw up the two O
Hella far from broke, the 40 won't choke plus a niggas still elope
Only cause I was raised in the hood




Raised by them hustlas them dealers on the block
It was plenty of them niggas on the spot
What you know bout that?
Turned up fully
The hood raised me, gang-banging made me a bully, ya dig
Burnt out and any party we at, you know it's turned out
The people talking the rumours
Now what you heard about?
How I spend 100 thou gettin' purped out
I'm strapped up, I keep a pistol for these suckers tryna act up
They know I'm famous like I won't get in the streets cuz
Like I don't come from the W, I'm a beast bru
What it do though, dickies for the dulo
Homie, you know skinny niggas sumo
Hella far from broke, the 40 won't choke plus a niggas still elope
Only cause I was raised in the hood

Congratulations, winner.

I had seen a lot of niggers come up in this game
But never did they make the look so good
From candy cars to bright yellow bras
The gangster white walls and the wood

You see, there comes a time in a man's life
Where you gotta choose the goods of the game
Oh, but it so hard to turn your back on a place
Where everybody knows your name

It's a cold game, I ain't been one to
Jump in and out of the range
Maybe an old school synagogue
Spinnin' the vision from which I faint

You got to do it, you can, gotta keep rhymin'
East Side High enjoyin' life, hair blowin' in the wind
The state that I'm in is gangster bliss
This is what you're callin' a sis
Passin' them off quick, memories missed

I made a lot of friends, a whole lot of money
Been down a couple times, but it never stopped my rhymin'
In fact, I got better, clutchin' on Beretta's
Blowin' a sticky, turn it to whether

A war shows in dough free lobos, this is how a player roll
And I never be questioned by some new young chump
Poppin' their toss, Snoopy D.O. made the way for you to walk
Owe it to the almighty, without you it couldn't be done
Your praise put the rise of the son, you dig?

Hold closer my hands from my throne
And I never be crucified within my own zone
Here is a very good reason to show love
But you gotta separate grown man from grown thug

From mamas goin' down for murder in '93
To keys all over the city bowlin' in Snoops league
I changed, I got smarter, I got a daughter
Two sons, beautiful wife for starters

I did it all, Jack, poppin' this peas
Eatin' international cuisine overseas, yeah
Don't judge me, you only knew Snoopy
You never tried to know Calvin, you tried to groove me up

Like some loco, I earned my respect
Did so much shit for the Coast, I should get a check
But all in all, I did it, B, cool as a blind with a C
Leveled my life as I push away the groupies
Snoopin' in a coopin', you can call me Uncle Snoopy

Don't worry about your circumstances
Take your chances, still from the B, L, B, C
For you are the C
Haler at you're the Snoopy
Haler at you're the Snoopy

I paid my dues
And now it's time to make a change
Gotta make that move
There's a time and place for everythin'

I paid my dues
And now it's time to make a change
Gotta make that move
There's a time and place for everythin'

I paid my dues
And now it's time to make a change
Gotta make that move
There's a time and place for everythin'

I paid my dues
And now it's time to make a change
Gotta make that move
There's a time and place for everythin'

Don't worry about your circumstances
Take your chances, still from the L B C
For you are the C
Haler at you're the Snoopy
Haler at you're the Snoopy

Can you be my doctor?
Can you fix me up?
Can you wipe me down?
So I can rock it rock it..

So I can make you give it up give it up
Until you say my name
Like a Jersey Jersey shuttin' down the game

Be my head coach
So you canyou can
And never take me out
Till you can taste the way
Do it again, and again till you say my name
And by the way I'm so glad

I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat
I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat
Sweat

I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat
I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat
Sweat, sweat

Can you, can you get me up like I'm late for my first class
So I can give it to you rough like a first draft
Hold you like a paper plane
You know I got paper babe
Them dollar bills
Girl I'll make it rain

Holiday Inn
Come and meet me on my eighth floor
Damn it feels good but I feel bad for them next door
I, I I I apologize
Whe when I slip slip slip like two girls into slip n' slide

I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat
I just wanna make you sweat

On the beach on the beach
Let me dip my feet in
And make you sweat

I wanna make you sweat
Sweat

Bet you get high but I ain’t smoking with the rest though
Cause if it’s in my joint, believe that it’s the best smoke
I’m talking OG kush from the West Coast
Watch how you hit it, just one hit will burn your chest, though


Cut those cameras on cause my camera’s on
And my niggas backing me riding around town
With a big old bag of weed
Taylor Gang, we ain’t in your faculty
Me and Snoop Dogg, we created a masterpiece
Smoke all day and we making this cash, and we
Bout it bout it like Master P
Go hard, stack ya cheese, roll a joint, pass the trees
TGOD, he’s the OG, real G shit what it has to be
My real niggas gon pop tags for me
Fake niggas gon get bags for me
Say you just wanna shake hands with me?
Same fuck niggas used to laugh at me
Now I’m riding around town in the car that you can’t even pronounce
And you can’t go fast as me
Smoking marijuana, and she know that I’m a player
So she wanna come up here spend that cash on me
That pimp shit come naturally
That fuck shit is wack to me
My kush grown organically
My balling is actually


Bet you get high but I ain’t smoking with the rest though
Cause if it’s in my joint, believe that it’s the best smoke
I’m talking OG kush from the West Coast
Watch how you hit it, just one hit will burn your chest, though
You like to smoke but you ain’t smoking what we smoking, no
You like to smoke but you ain’t smoking what we smoking, no


Let me turn you on to turn you out
To make you feel how you really wanna feel
For real, sho will, nigga I got that kill
You know what I got: Captain Crunch, soda pop
Light green kush cut from a bush
Mix it together, get it together
Hypo glow with the hydro flow
Smoking on some shit called I don’t know
This is that shit that was caught
From my niggas on the block with a .44 Glock—oh no!
Cutting it up, button it up
Homie don’t speak at all
You might stay, you might be most likely like shark bait
I might hate, nigga you smoking that lightweight
Wrong class, featherweight, levitate
Set it straight: let me break it down for you
Flip it, zip it, let it fly
If it’s good, it’s gonna get you high
Drop it, stop it, that ain’t the one
We don’t even smoke that shit for fun!




Yea nigga, I’m rolling up that high-grade
Chilling on the porch, smoking like it’s Friday
Every day of the week to Juicy J’s a high day
Niggas think I’m Chinese cause my eyes straight
I threw up a 6 into a 20 ounce
Smoked a half ounce of kush, felt like 20 ounces
Fucked around and popped a molly now I’m high as fuck
Every chick I'm seeing, Juicy screaming out, "Let’s fuck!"
I done popped a pill and hit the lean behind it
Where my mind? Somebody help me find it
Got a black and white bitch, they my mixed bitch

Zips smelling like the whole plants in my coat
For autographs, coming at me with all the names
And what I gotta have

We smoke the best you can buy
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us
Keep stunting just cause I can
These hoes know just who I am
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us


This one's for the g's all black Chuck's on the cuffs of my jeans
King size papes full of trees, I be with the boss dog(g) ya'll fuck niggas please
Now they say I'm hot, hundred somethin' degrees
Taking pictures with a young nigga cheese
Remember days homey, I ain't had a thing
Now I'm hoping off the plane putting roaches on the wing
And my hoes like queens, but we smoke like kings
Jewelry froze, like fling
Money come fast, yours slow like lean
Rolling up grass, so weed to have the stash, so I know I'm gonna fast
Third period, showing up last
With a late note blowin' green smoke




We blow to the middle of the day
Wiz say dawg put the middle of the jay
Hey, why not? Not why?

We fly, we ride, she high, he high, we high
Fuck it, everybody to the library
Got a new batch, some blue - booberry
Stuck in the hallway, with a pass say dawg he just smoke all day
It's a mind game like the ream I seem to keep migraines
I'm so lifted, like a parachuter
My grass day off day off Ferris Bueller
Slip away, dip away, almost had to throw a zip away
But fuck that, this Taylor Gang, what you want dog
Shit I'm on everythang




You niggas never had and you never will
You niggas never had and you never will
I said you niggas never had and you never will
Big Snoop and Wiz smoke with the kill (kill kill)

Holla at me when you graduate
We be posted right by the 400 building
Room 420
Follow your nose, your no-nose (ha-ha)

Niggas soft as doctors cock swab
You bitchin'

Honeydew, money do
But this ain't about no money, this about me and you making ooh
Take it from me, first day of school I'm looking cool, I got my clothes pressed

Find ways, to elevate it, motivate it, calculate it, reinstate it
Look at you girl, you got me dedicated

Uh, put me on the game
Though I keep my head in these books, I'm not a lame
Usually kinda square, I'm trying to use it for a change
Telling bitches things, like if wanna get with me you gon need a lot of brains
And just cause I don't play, who say I can't ball?
My nigga Mac, dude me and him is in the same hall
So don't get mad if I relax and get my bake on
Just promise that you'll try to catch me if my grades fall


I wanna go study, baby would you be my buddy?
and help me with my project, cause you are who I roll with

Spitting game, you know for reppin hard
Change that perspective, that's my objective
Cool and oh so collective, connected

See you the seed in my weed, baby help me grow
Let it go, let me know where to meet at
Student of the week, baby I will be that, you know I need that

So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We’re just having fun
We don’t care who sees
So what we go out?
That’s how its supposed to be
Living young and wild and free


So what I keep ‘em rolled up?
Saggin’ my pants, not caring what I show
Keep it real with my niggas
Keep it player for these hoes
And look clean don't it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501 jeans on it
Roll joints bigger than King Kong’s fingers
And smoke them hoes down ’til they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day
I’m with your bitch smokin’ grade A


You know what?
It’s like I’m 17 again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin’, on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh my god, I’m on the chase, Chevy
It's gettin’ kinda heavy, relevant, sellin’ it
Dippin’ away, time keeps slippin’ away
Zip in the safe, flippin’ for pay
Tippin’ like I’m drippin’ in paint
Up front, four blunts, like, “Khalifa put the weed in a J”




And I don't even care
Cause if me and my team in there
There's gonna be some weed in the air
Tell 'em Mac


Blowin' everywhere we goin' and now you knowin'
When I step right up, get my lighter so I can light up


That's how it should be done
Soon as you thinkin' you're down
Find how to turn things around
Now things are lookin' up


From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thang


Now I'm chillin', fresh outta class, feelin'
Like I'm on my own and I could probably own a building
Got my own car, no job, no children
Had a science project, me and Mac killed it


T-H-C, M-A-C, D-E-V, H-D-3, high as me
This is us, we gon' fuss
And we gon' fight and we gon' roll
And live off life




Yea, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you’re supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun
So we just, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you’re supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun

Have a little party at my crib
And all the weed is rolled that's how it is
When you fucking with some OG niggas blowing OG smoke
Don't even gotta ask, you already know, we 'bout to go


Young nigga that's more famous than these older niggas
Young nigga got my game up from these older niggas
Motherfuckas hear my name, I say I told you nigga
I was taught to count my paper 'fore I fold it nigga
Now look at my chains, all them things frozen nigga
Rolling up my Mary Jane before I smoke it with ya
Hit this J, I bet this be a day you don't remember
Looking at the top and I don't see not one contender
Cooking out the pot, I like my weed for lunch and dinner
Got some cookies in the jar, OG in the blender
You paying for quantity, but quality is what you spend for
If there's a marijuana-ology, I'll be your mentor
And all about this chronic leaf is what in for
So give your parents my apology for me again or
Get high like we Cheech and Chong
We gon' eat some brownies, we gon' smoke, we gon' need some bongs
Roll up so we can all




Killer Cali is what we blow
OG nigga from way down low
Known for banging the blue C rag
Started off smoking nothing but Zags
Popping P's, chopping trees
501's, all of these
All y'all invited, ignite it, light it, now follow me
Laid out, plush couch, flat screen television
Table full of vegetation so you just might stun a nigga
That's what it is, that's what it's gon' be
East Side Long Beach where I'm from
Bring your girls, all y'all come
Give me some, now give her some
It's big Mac, I love to have fun
You are, you are the one
If you get it or do it, then it'll be just like 2 on 1
Break it down, lay it down
Baby work that body like
At the pad, acting bad
Baby what that party like?
Moving so schizophrenic
Baby pull down your panties
Let the Doggy Dog ram it
I cram to undertsand it
Back room that's my bedroom
Make her right up in it
Close the door, smoke, oh fo sho
I'm 'bout to slide up in it
Smoke something




Having money and blowing hella chronic
Smoke I'm stunting
Cutlass on them chrome spokes with the engine running
Sounding like a dinosaur empty stomach rumbling
Your bitch at the window cause she know I'm coming
She tell you that she 'bout to go jogging and on the corner
She jump in, take her to the honeycomb
Stuffing kush in Raw cones, playing Megaman 3
Your Wonderwoman giving dome out Miami
Said she never leave me 'lone, She wan' have a family
She just high, tomorrow night, she'll be titties out, dancing
Trying to leave with the next nigga in a Aston
So why get caught up
I'm too swift up on my toes to have my name brought up
In sewing circles with them hoes
I rather be a straight G rolling up a whole
O-Z of that OG have them KO'ed

French inhale
I like the way you french inhale
Do it again
French inhale
I like the way you french inhale
Do it again


Uhh, you ain't gotta sell it, cause its already sold
And you ain't gotta roll one cause its already rolled
Check out my technique, just weed, let it flow
Shit, I've been smoking since I was 14 years old
I had a dime that never smoked blunts, just bowls
Taught me how to blow O's, inhale through my nose
So if you see me smoking don't blow my high
Uhhh, so I roll one and we both gonna fly
You smell it all in my clothes
I'm taking in all the smoke when I


French inhale
I like the way you french inhale
Do it again
French inhale
I like the way you french inhale
Do it again


I take it to the face, inhale it through my nose
Blowing with the homies on the low, man fuck these hoes
And crack-a-lac, peel it back
What you call a mack who crack a mad bitch like that?
A cracker jack
Im like a florist, touring like a tourist
Godzilla flyin on a pegasaurus
Niggas know about it, even fore I pull it out
I put some fire on it, and now they beggin me to put it out
I'm in the hallway, rolling on the purple psyche
I know the in's and out's so I'mma do what the fuck I like


French inhale
I like the way you french inhale
Do it again
French inhale
I like the way you french inhale
Do it again

Ohhhhhhhh ohhh ohhhhh ohh

They saw me on TV, now they gon' try they hardest to be me
Said she know just who I am and plus my team is undefeated
I'm the man in my city, if you want I got the key
and I could put you on the game or on the ocean by the beach
Everything you see I own, I don't gotta lease
If your bitch outta control better put that hoe on a leash
Umm (it could be easy) if you listen to what I'm tryin to tell ya
Every dime pays but they catch you messin with that high grade
they gon' try and fail ya - call up moms, tell her
you in the hallway, plus your clothes smell kinda familiar
I ain't trippin, I'm twistin up another one
Got a couple problems with my bitches dawg cause pimpin ain't (easy)
I'm rollin up trees, stayin low from police
And don't ask where I been, Dogg I'm goin where the G's be
Haters talk when I leave, they just front when they see
what they want, say they don't but they need me
I'm like a fuckin Game Genie
Young nigga but I make it look easy


It could be easy
But the smallest little things we make so hard
Make so hard, make so hard
Yeah just like a free throw, life it be so easy
It could be easy
Well then tell me would you really be who you are?
Who you are, who you are
And it's been done before, I think you should know, know, know

It can all be so easy
It could be easy


Flyin on a plane plane, dippin to this thang, bang
Never the same gang, she ask me if I gang bang
If Peter Piper pick 'em, then Snoopy Doopy pimp 'em
The track is where I kick 'em, now baby suck a dick up
until you start to hiccup, now look here breezy
It's real hard, but you can make it easy
I am pleasurable, now baby please me
And once I get up in it, I'll make you need me
(It could be easy) Like I love weed leaf
Baby starvin, now she feed me, believe me, you complete me
Protect the spot, and when I'm in school
Lay low, be cool, connect the dots, I do it vagrantly
Truant agencies on my wingtips
I ditched English, for Olde English
40-ounce loc, with some buddha Thai, mix it with some kush slow
With a E.T. high, so, I'ma phone home
Baby on some knick-knack, paddy-whack, give her Doggy bone
We +Home Alone+, now she's suckin on my bone
Macaulay, Phifer, NASCAR driver
Rollin with a real Eastsider
It could be easy

Uhh
Keep sayin I'll do this, I'll do that
But you know
I just keep doin the same shit
Haha, my fault, ha!


I'm not tryin to be right, tryin to be wrong
I'm just tryin to make it out here on my own
I say I do a lot of things but I'll (but I'll)
Probably never change (change)
I'm not tryin to be right, tryin to be wrong
I'm just tryin to make it out here on my own
I say I do a lot of things but I'll (but I'll)
Probably be the same (same)


Every time I try to get my life together someone sees
what you're doin, tryin to ruin my hopes and my dreams
Push away, and always gon' get away
It keeps them grams in my pants, never hit a day
Am I wrong? Am I right? Do I care? Livin life
On my own, cop a zone, what it feelin like
Transition, premonition, whatchacallit, Mac a bone
Do my thang with my gang, put your back up on
Recollect and reflect, on how I used to be
I'm probably the same way cuz cause I'm gon' keep it G
Secretly, sacredly, y'all wake and bake with me
Solo creepin on the dolo tippin like a low-low
Fans come in vans and clans expectin to get that photo
Or either come backstage and have a chance to hit my dodo
Cool individual, I'm never too good
See Mac is from the hood, and never Hollywood




Uh, growin up I ain't know as much
I was too busy chasin money and rollin stuff 'fore I was old enough
Gettin every dollar and fold it up
Puttin all our weed in papers instead of blunts so they can know it's us
Every party we showin up
Baggie full of pre-rolls, light it up and pass it
You holdin that one too long nigga, matter fact you can have it
Another one in rotation, my motivation is cabbage
My Roley face filled with karats
And niggaz think they are but they know that they ain't comparin
And ain't doin no harm, I just don't think I'm into carin
I keep makin deposits and know ain't no interference from your broke ass
I just keep hustlin all the time and gettin mo' cash
And rollin weed, you smell the chronic when I go past
You look at me and then put down notes on your notepad
Yeah I'm kinda high, but you should know that - hahaha

I'm smoking everywhere I go
(No stick, no seeds, just Al Green)
I always gotta keep one rolled
(I keep that, need that, got that)
I'm rolling every gram I own
(that purp, that bomb, that kush)
don't gotta understand, they know
I smoke that, fire that, good that good that


Concentrated, everyday I'm faded
tree's prepared and properly cultivated
I nursed 'em, sprayed down, no chemicals
just me and my buddy, ya hear me now
never treat ya wrong, to each his own
Snoop and Wiz the new Cheech and Chong
we up in smoke, making street schemes
smoking sticky green, having sweet dreams
break it down, put it in the zig zag
and pull the top back and let the ass drag
hit the switch, quickest way to get a bitch
executive branch, get a whiff of this
black car, sack a dank
high school nigga what the fuck you think
I'm passing all my classes with flying colors
and everyday I'm high as a muthafucker


I'm smoking everywhere I go
(No stick, no seeds, just Al Green)
I always gotta keep one rolled
(I keep that, need that, got that)
I'm rolling every gram I own
(that purp, that bomb, that kush)
don't gotta understand, they know
I smoke that, fire that, good that good that


Sun roof open, smoking while I'm rolling
my bitches only notice it if its potent
bottle of Perignon, we can go kick it by the ocean
get in between your legs
join roaches and ashes all in your bed
you calling her babe, she calling me instead

getting money, going hard for my profit
bad bitch keep the joint stuffed like stockings
young nigga getting bread, why knock it

I'm sittin on my porch watchin the law
As they ride past in they patrol cars
So tell me why I feel like the enemy
They're supposed to be here protectin me
I might have went too far
Helpin' to contribute to makin their job hard
Servin' fiends like these people ain't no kin to me
I can't believe I'm out here killin my community
If you knew how far I came (far I came)
From where I am and where I used to be (where I used to be)
I don't want it, you can tell by the look at me
This gangsta life ain't no longer in me


And I'm tired of the runnin', tired of the runnin'
Tired of the runnin', runnin' from the law
Baby you gotta believe me

Tired of the runnin', runnin' from the law

I know there's things I could've changed girl
I know there's things I could've done a lot better
Instead I'm in the streets tryin to make that cheddar
Thinkin in my mind that you gon' be there forever
I know I could've let it all go (let it all go)
But I was thinkin it would make life better (make life better)
Instead I'm sittin in this cell writin this letter
Thought I wouldn't get caught cause I was way too clever
I learned there's no one to catch ya when ya fallin
And they'll be no one to hear you when you're callin
Do you know what it's like to wake up in the mornin
While you're starvin you're hearin bugs crawlin
Reminiscin' on them days you was walkin'
With pretty women on your arm while you're flossin'
Thankful that I didn't end up in a coffin
Somethin you see too often


And I'm tired of the runnin', tired of the runnin'
Tired of the runnin', runnin' from the law
Baby you gotta believe me
Said I'm tired of the runnin', tired of the runnin'

I heard him speak but then a saw his face
I knew we was the one because I dreamt this day
I was such a beginner on this thing called love
And now he's going away and now I'm torn apart, so torn apart


You're one of them, you see me swear
You pullin' triggers let you slide another day
Say goodbye to the one that got away


Her lips for the very first thing that I saw
She threw like an angel and that made want some more
My reputation says I'm there from now
And now she's going away and now I'm so torn apart, so torn apart


You're one of them, you see me swear
You pullin' triggers let you slide another day
Say goodbye to the one that got away


Never let you give up
But I should've let you got away
Got away, got to find another way
Never let 'em get away
Gotta find a way to stay
Never let 'em get away
Never let 'em get away

You never let her go
You never let her go

You see me?
You hear me?
Ye


You're one of them, you see me swear
You pullin' triggers let you slide another day
Say goodbye to the one that got away

Tonight, there's gonna be a whole lot of smoke in the air
Blow it hard for the ones who ain't here
Seems like every day we're putting one six feet underground
So blessed - what goes up, must come down


Now my buzz is gone, I need to re-up on reality
Can't let them see me weak, I need to pause on it
Is there any possibility that everyone feels like me?


Ashtrays and heartbreaks
I lost some, let's toast to one
So put 'em high, let's reminisce
You're gone, but you never miss
Ashtrays and heartbreaks
I lost some, let's toast to one
So raise a glass to the memories
Set 'em free and fill up all those ashtrays
Fill up all those ashtrays


Tomorrow when you wake up and realize life ain't fair
Throw it back, and make the whole world disappear
You never miss what you had until it's gone
When it's right, something always will go wrong


Now my buzz is gone, I need to re-up on reality
Can't let them see me weak, I need to pause on it
Is there any possibility that everyone feels like me?


Ashtrays and heartbreaks
I lost some, let's toast to one
So put 'em high, let's reminisce
You're gone but you never miss
Ashtrays and heartbreaks
I lost some, let's toast to one
So raise a glass to the memories
Set 'em free and fill up all those ashtrays
Fill up all those ashtrays


Now my buzz is gone, I need to re-up on reality
Can't let them see me weak, I need to pause on it

You're gone but you never miss
Ashtrays and heartbreaks

So raise a glass to the memories
Set 'em free and fill up all those ashtrays
Fill up all those ashtrays

Defined with no compliance but my alliance
I'm cold with it, roll with it, so go get it
Take some, bass drum, so vivid

Follow the policy, this a little DP-ology
Dress code, cut-off khakis with Wallabees
Yes sir, we does the most
So I'd like to give a toast to the coast, black excellence

Ain't no blank spots, just all go tank tops
I'm realer than real and my word is my bond
Pop a bottle of Don and blow a blunt with LeBron
I'm on my way to the tip, ain't no cookies and milk
Just satin and silk, I look for my quill
We writing the script, flipping the shit like a flapjack
Boss lady, that's my queen, blackjack
21, get it done, we having fun
Make dough, legs show, let's make a run
Real talk, boss dog, you are the one
The star, the light, and the sun

"Well, you're caught, motherfucker
Went to the studio, they said you weren't there all day
Still continue to lie
I don't know why I'm fuckin' worried about it, you know what I'm saying?
But I fucked up
Don't fucking come looking for me and shit
If you're just gonna fuckin' lie to me
I don't understand what's going through your head
You wanna be with other bitches, go be with other bitches
You don't need to be with me, the fuck?
Leave me the fuck alone"


Seems like wintertime in June
After all we've been through
Seems dark, it's only noon
All of our ups and down, we've changed
Girl, I love you, ooh, forever
I can't stand you, stand you never


Girl, I just wanna lay and chill wit'chu
You're more than a summer fling and I was wondering
Can we go back to makin' love
The way we did when I was fresh out?

Ooh, baby
Now you got a nigga stressed out
I just wanted to be cool


Seems like wintertime in June

Ooh, baby

Wintertime with my baby
It's cold, bring that thang close to me like we're supposed to be

I just need you to be cool


Seems like wintertime in June (Wintertime)

Wintertime (It will change)
With my baby (Feelings change)
Wintertime in June

Woo

Ask whip, with Doc and Mac, ay
You know when you step on that
300 to 500 feet where towers is on deck with lemons on 'em
(Man help yourself)
Ice cold Mimosas and shit
Oh yeah, it's 6AM where I'm at
Cloud 9 to be exact
It took a long time to get here
I make it look easy
But it took a long time to get in this chair that I'm sittin' in right now
(You have no idea)

But the main idea is to get her to dance to my song (Dance to my song)
Quite frankly, don't wanna see with nothin' on (Nothin' on)
No robes on tonight, no shoes on tonight (No shoes on tonight)
She goin' deep sea diving, goin' down, down, down tonight (Keep rising)
And I'ma keep rising to the top (Keep rising to the top)
Keep rising to the top (Keep rising to the top)
Keep going, go on boy, don't ever stop
I'm gonna keep rising to the top (Keep rising to the top)
Keep rising to the top (Keep rising to the top)
When I take off or blast off, I ain't never stop (Don't ever stop no, no)

This feel like a cocaine song, my bulk game strong
Baby say my stroke game long
She on everything, move and choose up, who ya choosin'?
In it to win it, get it crackin', now how ya doin'?
Manoeuvrin' while we movin'
Smoky in this motherfucker while we crusin'
We off the coast of France with a host of friends
Coastal winds get close again, you the most advanced
Take my hand, go with the flow, do what I say
And walk it out and pay attention, don't you give it away
And once we make that clear, I'ma tell you what you wanna hear, yeah

But the main idea is to get her to dance to my song (Dance to my song)
Quite frankly, don't wanna see with nothin' on (Nothin' on)
No robes on tonight, no shoes on tonight (No shoes on tonight)
She goin' deep sea diving, goin' down, down, down tonight (Keep rising)
And I'ma keep rising to the top (Keep rising to the top)
Keep rising to the top (Keep rising to the top)
Keep going, go on boy, don't ever stop
I'm gonna keep rising to the top (Keep rising to the top)
Keep rising to the top (Keep rising to the top)
When I take off or blast off, I ain't never stop (Don't ever stop no, no)

Uh, shawty my lil boo thing, put in that move sayin'
CREAM like Wu-Tang yeah
Got in that mad shit, 'cause I'm rich and handsome
Diamonds on me dancin', yeah
Smokin' on exotics, say she from the Tropics
It look like she brought it, don't care though
Fuckin' fix the stitches in her hair though
Fuck yo last nigga I know you used to the middle

Baby, don't deny what you here for
Wetter than the dimes on my earlobes
Lookin' in my eyes like it's tenfold
Wanna knock boots like Timbo's
All up in your water I'm so nautical with it
I see what I want and I gotta go get it
Once we get goin' I won't stop till you finish
But the main I, but the main idea

Is to get her to dance to my song (Dance to my song)
Quite frankly, don't wanna see with nothin' on (Nothin' on)
No robes on tonight, no shoes on tonight (No shoes on tonight)
She goin' deep sea diving, goin' down, down, down tonight (Keep rising)
And I'ma keep rising to the top (Keep rising to the top)
Keep rising to the top (Keep rising to the top)
Keep going, go on boy, don't ever stop
I'm gonna keep rising to the top (Keep rising to the top)
Keep rising to the top (Keep rising to the top)

(Focus on me
Baby, can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?)
Focus on me

So much smoke in the air, you can't see shit
Servin' Crip dick 'til the bitch sea sick
Bought everything, I don't lease shit, G shit
Workin' out so the fleece fit, cool
I'm on that who-you-wanna-be shit
West to East shit for all my dawgs and my Heathcliffs
Streets on tax so the heat's on my lap
When it's war, fuck the law, fuck it, bury me strapped
Money long as 21 Cadillacs
Matter fact, get it scratched like BattleCat
Hood politics, every real nigga battles that
Still standin' 'cause the way a nigga handled that
10 toes down, never actin' like a mark
Only nigga with a star that got put on at the Park, nigga
That's on the set, that's on my mama
I could still pull up at the Park, nigga

Focus on me
On god, I did that, I did that
Focus on me
10 toes, I did that, I did that
Focus on me
Every word I rapped, nigga, I lived that
Focus on me
Give it up, I did that, I did that

Gangbangers rejoice when they hear my voice
Pullin' up in Rolls Royce, the hood in full-force still
Realizing I'm the source still
The wrong move could get my boys killed
So I focus on me
Makin' sure this whole shit stay rollin'
And my baby boo neck stay frozen
Rich rollin', on the clock, non-stop
And my bank account sure shows it
Big mouth Crip and the bitch niggas can't close it
I was chosen
So don't worry 'bout mine, nigga, we good
And fuck what y'all think, "Free Suge"
Diamond in the back with the leather with the wood in it
Banged around the world, made sure I kept the hood in it
Yeah, one time for the king
And I still smoke a nigga like a big bag of weed
On moms

Focus on me
On god, I did that, I did that
Focus on me
10 toes, I did that, I did that
Focus on me
Every word I rapped, nigga, I lived that
Focus on me
Give it up, I did that, I did that

(Focus on me
Baby, can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?)

Grow man, thug it out, stand tall
Who sold millions of records and balled?
Never slowed up, no no, not at all
From the streets of Long Beach, it's the Dogg

Was always showin' love and big respect for all the Blood homies (Whuttup!)
You understood the values in the youth
Man, I swear to God, nephew, you was the truth
Damn, how could this nigga do this?
It's 'cause every neighborhood Jesus, got a neighborhood Judas
Who hate to see your team ridin' rich
You see that envy and that pride
That's that green eyed bitch
Worse than a woman scorned (Damn)
It'd be better for that man if he had never been born
But Mary, don't you mourn, Martha, don't you weep
You see, your son still affected us deep
Give us the faith to take that leap

Standing up together like we did back on them slave ships
Out on high sea waves, fighting other whips
Steady hearing "Jesus saves" out of devils lips
Shackled at the hips for the color of our skin
Hundreds of us, yeah, we knew we was brothers then
But here we go again, underneath the gun
They got us thinkin' we all different when we (One)

Especially when we was down, that nigga picked niggas up
Gangbang on NY stages, hit niggas up (Death Row)

Yeah, he did some bullshit, I'm admitting that
But coming at a real Crip like he ain't one
Especially when he help fucking make one

Told Daz, "Hook him up," brought straight up out the box
Here's the gang, here's the beats
Here's the keys, here's the locks
Then he hid them niggas (Yes, sir)

DJ Warren G, Dr. Dre
City of Compton, City of Long Beach
Death Row Records will go down in history, nigga
We did that, yeah, nigga, we did that
Done



"I would like to say to this gentleman and all other people who are not blessed with melanin at this point in time to understand that what has happened in our history is that you have been misinformed as much as we have been misinformed
Much of the information that is brought forth, not only from Doctor Mohammed, but other areas, other scholars, are not available to you as a sister said in your curriculum that you've had for 400 years when you did not allow us to read and write, it was being hidden
Whether you, sir, personally did that or not, it was a legacy that was passed onto you
And I end by saying the Holocaust is simply the greatest atrocity on film
Ours was not filmed"

To all my sisters, Mother Earth has birthed us
Lurchers, it hurts us first, less heard this
To all my sisters, ain't no knockin' you back
Politicans politickin' with a gown and a cap
The house got flavor and I like it like that
Black girl power, yeah, I'm rockin' with that

Presidents meetin' overseas just to have a sitdown

The foundation was laid, y'all nation was made
Off our ancestors' back, back, back in the day
Four hundred years ago, y'all made us slaves
And you can hear it in the spirit comin' deep from the graves
Life is a maze
Smoke so much dope you in a daze
But you ain't trippin', you gettin' paid
Who do you praise? But anyways
I read a history book, but I ain't learned nothin', dawg
So I read the Bible, then the holy Quran
Went to Jamaica to acquire my knowledge
Sat with some Rastas 'til my game got polished
The gangbang extreme with malice
Trees and degrees like I'm trained for college

They tryna keep us from runnin' up
I never tell you to get down, it's all about comin' up

"You need do this, you need to do that"

Let me tell you somethin'
It's everybody's favorite crip cousin, Snoop Dogg
Inductin' these woop hoes as loopholes
Death rowin' them blue drawers, bitch niggas
Good on both sides like switch hitters
Snitches get stitches, send cliques to get niggas
For you to smoke with me cuz, you need 6 figures
Ask your bitch 'bout the dick, yeah, my shit glitter

Nigga, what you talkin' 'bout? (Huh?)
If it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?
If it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?
If it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?

'Cause I done changed so many lives with my vibe
Made sure my crips and my wroos all survive
Long Beach throwin' up C's in my stores
Hollywood store, Twin Towers with the boys, nigga
Switchin' bitches like I switch cars
Lil' homies on go, and keep the licks for us
Walkin' in the church, smellin' like a lit forrest
We still good 'cause a real one kept the shit goin'

Nigga, what you talkin' 'bout? (What?)
If it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?

It don't stop, it don't stop

But that comes with the game, my nigga, hate it or love it
So what we really talkin' 'bout, if we ain't talkin' 'bout
What I'm talkin' 'bout
'Cause what I'm talkin' 'bout got niggas hella bags
Sophisticated crippin' with the ghetto swag
Three-piece suit with a black and a yellow rag, tied in a knot
Rollin' down the Laundro got my eyes on the opps
Got my eyes on the cops, got my eyes on the block
Fresh off stage, rich or broke loco, shit don't change
Where I'm from (Long Beach)

Nigga, what you talkin' 'bout? (What?)
If it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?
If it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?
If it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?

Fuck outta my face with that shit, man
(Makin' this shit)
It's what we do
Right on, right on
(Makin' this shit)



There are times when I don't wanna speak
Grab a pen, scratch your chin, make the beat
Maybe not, smokin' pot on the beach
Paranoid with my boys, where my keys?
And my head in the clouds, is that him?
And my boys trippin' hard like nigga, chill
Someone new with the mouthful of boot
Now my boys, they come in with the deal

I'm not mad at you
Things I'm going through make me act the fool
Please don't think I'm cruel
Really normally I'm cool
There is nothing you can do
Hey
When my words are few
Things ain't what they seem
Feeling like I'm fooling me
I know God is calling me
I'm not where I'm supposed to be
Sitting here smoking trees
When I should be on my knees
When my words are few

Why you hounding me in the house of the lord?
Watch us, guilty
Ain't no move in the parking lot prophecies
That's why act an addiction, you can't find me

No bitches, please
Ain't no rest for my soul til' I come clean
I'll hear from the lord if I speak
So back off and let me eat, let me feast

Things I'm going through make me act the fool
Please don't think I'm cruel
Really normally I'm cool
There is nothing you can do
Hey

Feeling like I'm fooling me
I know God is calling me
I'm not where I'm supposed to be
Sitting here smoking trees
When I should be on my knees
When my words are few

I'm gonna tell you a story
I want to tell you a story about a man that's been so good to me
And when telling this story
I hope it bless you
Because I want you to sit your kids down, and tell them this story

Back when I was a little boy, you see
My life wasn't always perfect (perfect)
I remember my grandma praying
And she said one day it'll be perfect
She said, "Sit yourself down and listen to me
And let me tell you a little story
This story won't take to long
But I'ma tell you about his glory"
She said

My God!
Is the man that died for me
My God!
Said he gave me victory
My God!
Will supply your every need
My God!
His love is all I need

I said it happened sixty years ago
When I was washed up in his blood
Saved my soul and he set me free
Now I'm praising the lord above
I never thought that I could change
Until he saved a wretch like me
Now I'm here to tell the story
So that that you will be set free!


Well once upon a time in the Church of God
There was sinners and saints
Evens to odds
Do's and don'ts
Wills and won'ts
The haves to the have-nots
Will be sittin' up front
Gettin' the sermon up close
 the reverend  the offerings
We live in a benevolent lifetime, so stay right
I'm preachin' 'em teachin' 'em givin' em more than a look
My granny raised me right about the Good Book


She said, My God!
Is the man that died for me
My God!
Said he gave me victory
My God!
Will supply your every need
My God!
His love is all I need
My God!
Is the man that died for me
My God!
Said he gave me victory
My God!
Will supply your every need
My God!
His love is all I need




Heavenly Father
Give power to me
Over temptation
In my hour of need
Say I'm not forsaken
Shower over me
All of Your patience
My stone ain't ready


Been a sinner for a while now
All of Your forgiveness
I might not deserve it
Sort of known to wild out
Okay to let your flaws show
Nobody is perfect
Hard for me to bow down
I was taught to stand up to anybody, anywhere, for anything
My hood, holy ground
Street war for fun
Taught to walk through hellfire with the kerosene
So quick to turn it up a notch
Low profiles, spinning, burnin' up the lot
Always got that new thing turning up ya block
Always drive-by shooting, hard to make it stop
Pray for me
I'm something like a work in progress
Somebody already know
Pray for me
We already knew I needed someone to save my soul

Heavenly Father
Give power to me
Over temptation
In my hour of need
Say I'm not forsaken
Shower over me
All of Your patience
My stone ain't ready

Let Him chisel away away away
Let Him chisel away away away
Let Him chisel away away away
Please believe
He's workin' on me
He's workin' on me
Jesus


Heaven Father, let me lead by example
Let me be Your servant
Give you the true word that's spoken
Have ya heard it?
Have ya noticed?
Don't be deceived
By temptation of man
Realize, understand
That it's not your plan
That it's only God's plan (say what?!)
Do you really understand?
Open ya hands
Close em, praise Him
For all salvation
Give You the praisin'
Welcome to the party
So glad that you made it
My wrongs, my rights
I put em in yo faith
Just love, no hate
Try to keep us all straight
Till we see that day
See
Life is how you make it
Reject it, or you take it
Be real, or you fake it
Mistake and be patient
I'm tellin' you now
Things gettin' real in the situation, boy
Don't fake it
24/7 tryna get in heaven
But ya attitude and ya mind state
Don't bite more than you can chew, homeboy
Don't try to eat the whole plate

Heavenly Father
Give power to me
Over temptation
In my hour of need
Say I'm not forsaken
Shower over me
All of Your patience
My stone ain't ready

Let Him chisel away away away
Let Him chisel away away away
Let Him chisel away away away
Please believe
He's workin' on me
Keep workin' on me

Oh thank you Lord
Standing hollerin' God we trust

See believing is really knowing the unknown
Something we can not see
So far gone, that's come blind to our eyes
But it's time for us to wake up and realise we need God



You are, like a gentle breeze
And the thought of You takes me
Back down memory lane
Lord, I remember what You did for me
You sacrificed for me
You gave Your life for me

It's really unbelievable that You love me so much
It's really incredible how I'm healed by Your touch
In spite of my flaws
You answer my calls
It's really unbelievable that Ya
You're so incredible

You kept me alive (yes You did)
In spite of my sin
Brought me so very far
From where I started
Even before I was born
You made me to win
Lord, I think it's incredible
Jesus, You are incredible

Where would I be? (I would be nothing)
My life would be nothing
So incomplete (if it wasn't)
If it wasn't for Your love



He brought me through hard trials
He brought me through tribulations
Never let a day go by and not realize
Had not been for the Lord who was on my side
Back was against the wall
He looked out for me
He heard my cry and rescued me
Never let a day go by and not realize we are blessed

Don't take it for granted that we are here today
Just know that we're blessed and highly favored
Just know that we're blessed and highly favored

Just know that we're blessed and highly favored

Reppin', for the lord, no weapon will be formed

Seems like he testing me again

I said I woke up early this morning
I'm nowhere near where I need to be
But look at me, I'm feeling free this morning
Get out my bed, move my head, stand on my feet
I'm thankin' Jesus this morning, yeah
I know I don't talk to Ya much
When times get rough
I'm on my knees and I'm callin' You
Cause I know that You will always bring me through
And I know the plan, yes
Sometimes I take advantage
But at times I try to do
Things on my own
And I make a big mess
But I know God got my back
Even when self don't know how to act, yeah

I'm not letting one minute, moment, second pass
Without saying, "Thank You, Lord"
Thank You, Lord
For Your many blessings
Gave me everything I need and more
Even when I don't deserve it
You still watch over my family
And keep 'em safe from all harm and danger
A better man is what I'm tryna be

So I praise Him, praise Him, praise Him
I just lift my hands and clap 'em, clap 'em
Praise Him, praise Him, praise Him
I just lift my hands and clap 'em, clap 'em
Praise Him, praise Him, praise Him
I just lift my hands and clap 'em, clap 'em
Thank Ya, thank Ya, thank Ya
I just lift my hands and clap 'em, clap 'em

I know this is something I shoulda been doing
No excuses, I know the Word, I was raised the right way
I was off track doing no good
But thank the Lord I got a second chance to make it right back
Would I be a fools to look back to the hills
From which cometh my help
Lord knows I need help
If not I might fail
Thought I was doing great, but
I was just feeling myself, so

I'm not letting one minute, moment, second pass
Without saying, "Thank You, Lord"
Thank You, Lord
For Your many blessings
Gave me everything I need and more
Even when I don't deserve it
You still watch over my family
And keep 'em safe from all harm and danger
A better man is what I'm tryna be

So I praise Him, praise Him, praise Him
I just lift my hands and clap 'em, clap 'em
Praise Him, praise Him, praise Him
I just lift my hands and clap 'em, clap 'em
Praise Him, praise Him, praise Him

No shame, we admit it

Oh, send a new wave
Do a new thing

The world, it needs to follow You
And I think of all the days my hope was through
And still you came and brought me through

Brought me through from shame, temptation
Hopelessness, no motivation
Accusers in the waves throwing dirt on my name, yeah
What's my name without Your love?
(What's my name without You?)
Will not make it without Your love
(I won't make it)

God, send a new wave
Do a new thing, yeah
Don't wait
Please move
In new ways
Do new things
So we wait on You, yes!

And I think of all the things You brought me through
The world, it needs to follow You
I think of all those days my hope was through
But still You came and brought me through

I can't be without Your love
I can't be without You
I can't do it, no
Won't you help me say it
I can't be without Your love
I can't be without Ya
I can't, I can't alone

And I think of all the things You brought me through
The world, it needs to follow You
I think of all those days my hope was through
But still You came and brought me through

So, send a new wave
Do a new thing
Don't wait
Please move
In new ways
Do new things, yes
We wait on You!

Please move
Please move
Please do things
I know You can
I know

Came back for Him, the body was gone
All that was left was the stone
The Sword it was on
Two feet, on two wings
Blood and meat from the bone
A risen kingdom, but no mobile phones
Just faithful messengers
Everyday is being used in mysterious ways
And everything is a cost with some pain
Some lonely days, Jehovah knows
High on the throne, Christ to the right
This pen can't write the sights of my home
In spite of miracles, doubt abounds
Octo-, with tentacles
I can't make it without the faith to know
It's only Christ that rights the fights of unknown

I can't make it without the faith to know
It's only Christ that rights the fights of unknown

I can't make it without the faith to know
It's only Christ that rights the fights of unknown





A lotta times
You see performing for thousands of people
Filling their hearts with love and joy
Not knowing that I'm going through so much pain
But God knows everything
And I mean everything that I'm going through


Pain
Pain
God knows about your pain
Pain
Pain
God knows about your pain

Feeling so alone and deserted
People standing all around you
You walk around, hey
With a fake smile on your face
Cuz you don't nobody to know what you're going through, no
But your weeping may endure for a night
But your joy is coming in the morning
But you weeping may endure for a night
But your joy is coming, oh

Pain
Pain
God knows about your pain, oh
Pain
Pain
God knows all about your pain

Feeling so alone and deserted
People stand all around you
Walk around
Head up with foolish pride
Cuz you don't want nobody to know what you're going through, oh
But your weeping may endure for a night
But your joy is coming in the morning
But your weeping may endure for a night
But your joy comes in the morning

Comes in the morning
Morning, ooh yeah
It comes in the morning
 cause it holds me fast
Clouds in the sky, hurrying by
I know it's alright, Jesus is mine

Joy comes in the, joy comes in the
Joy comes in the morning time
Joy!
Joy!
Joy comes in the

Joy comes in the morning
Break it down one more time for me
But your weeping may endure for a night
But your joy comes in the morning

Oh my God
If you're good long enough you'll know it won't need to rain
With just one sunrise
My life, bumps & bruises
Battle scars had to prove my loyalty for my hood
These are better days
Voices from vices got me standing me here
Send the greatest to your neighbor
For saving me from my yesterday
Second chances come with every sunrise

I wake up feeling like the Most Highs favorite child
Cause he gave me you
A breath of fresh air and a brand new morning
Baby blue
I wake up blessed and highly favored just to see
Another day was proof that
Second chances come with every sunrise


My life bumps and bruises
Tribulations and trials, but I made it through
So it's all good
These are better days
I just want you to know
I've been to the bottom of the barrel of my pride
And I fell down by surprise
Life has been adopted with his sunrise

I wake up feeling like the Most Highs favorite child
Cause he gave me you
A breath of fresh air and a brand new morning
Baby blue
I wake up blessed and highly favored just to see
Another day was proof that
Second chances come with every sunrise


Shout it out to the world
IG posted it
If you get a second chance, you better make the most of it
I used to ride with the gun guys
Blaze to the fun times
But nowadays, I just praise until the sunrise
Been down so long
I'm used to falling, y'all
But I recognize, this my calling dawg
I been ordained, anointed with the oil
On the battlefield
Loyal to the soil
You're lookin' at the man in the mirror
See now things is gettin' much clearer
I got my own church, my own grind, my own band
I guess you could say, I'm a brand new man
See rap guys usually only baptize
But how could you cleanse your sins without it
Make you wanna think about it, uh
Right reverend the reverend right recite light
You see today is the day to get your life right

I wake up feeling like the Most Highs favorite child
Cause he gave me you
A breath of fresh air and a brand new morning
Baby blue
I wake up blessed and highly favored just to see
Another day was proof that
Second chances come with every sunrise

For those of you that don't have anything to believe in
This song right here's for you
I'm here to tell you the power of somebody I know personally
Listen to me

There is power
Glory, faith and strength
In Jesus

If you enjoyed waking up with that food on your table, say amen
If you enjoyed putting money in your pocket, say amen
If you know God is able to cure anything, say amen
If you know that he's able and willing to cure you, say amen

There is power
Glory, faith and strength
In Jesus

Don't you enjoy waking up in the morning, period
Say yeah
And I know you gotta love when you're sick, and the doctor say it ain't serious, say yeah
It could be worse, you could be hurt, living in the streets, under a bridge
Don't shoot the messenger, just tell it like it is

I'm sorry y'all, I'm just telling it like it is
I'm just speaking my mind on behalf of the Lord
And I just wanna let you know
You need to get on your knees and pray and thank Him for everything, no matter what situation

There is power
Glory, faith and strength
In Jesus





Father, we pray this morning for the spirit of wisdom and revelation, and the knowledge of Jesus Christ
We thank You and we pray for the sick, the shut-in
We pray for the young people, we pray for the babies
We pray for everyone that's sick this morning
Everyone that's lost this morning
In the name of Jesus, we thank You
Hallelujah, we thank You for Your love, we thank You for Your power, thank You
For You are greater than all

Satan, the Lord rebuke you
Satan, the Lord rebuke you
Satan, the Lord rebuke you
He's defeated again


Changed my hustle to witness
All the things I did wrong
Gave me a brand new message -
Gave me a brand new song
So now I can't be threatened
By the drama and the tricks you bring
For I will not be defeated -
For there is joy in the song that I sing

(Satan)
Satan, the Lord rebuke you. (Oh Satan)
Satan, the Lord rebuke you. (Satan, the Lord Rebuke you)
Satan, the Lord rebuke you. (Ooh, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah)
He's defeated (defeated) again (again - everybody)

Satan, the Lord rebuke you. (Ooh, Satan the Lord rebuke ya')
Satan, the Lord rebuke you. (Rebuke you, yeah)
Satan, the Lord rebuke you. (You are defeated)
He's defeated again. (again - listen)

Open your ears - open your eyes
Everything you're trying to do
You gotta know, gotta reinvent it
(Or we will) never gain and introduce to you. (oh my)
The enemy promised (enemy, he promised) said he promised
He'll steal and destroy
But the Bible says, no weapon formed against me
Will prosper or take my joy!
My joy!

Satan, the Lord rebuke you. (Wooh! Satan, the Lord rebuke you.)
Satan, the Lord rebuke you. (Hah, Ooh, Satan)
Satan, the Lord rebuke you. (Rebuke you - yeah)
He's defeated again. (Defeated wooh - everybody sing)

Satan, the Lord rebuke you. (He's rebuked in here, he is)
Satan, the Lord rebuke you. (Yo Snoop, y'all break it down for me)

He's defeated (Can I get a real witness in here)
He's defeated (Now I don't look like the things I been through, somebody help me)
He's defeated (Can you grab somebody's hand and rock with me, good evening)
He's defeated (I need a few of the holies to open your mouth and say it with me - oh!)

He's defeated (I don't fear the terror by night)
He's defeated (Nor do I fear the arrow by day, uh huh)
He's defeated (Jesus made me a promise)
He's defeated (He has all power in His hand)

He's defeated again!

(Oh Lord, we rebuke the devourer and deceiver)





Heavenly Father, I wanna thank you for what you've done for me
In my life, I try so hard to be faithful, and I am faithful to you
And my soul just running away to you, and I want you to grab my hand and hold me
I know, I know, I know
One of these days, I'm gonna run away to you
Yes I am
Whoah, yes I am

Make me wanna run away
Pack my bags and get away
On my knees at night, I pray
That we will live another day
You always got something to say

In the kitchen with my kinfolk, cookin'
They say the devil always show up when you're not lookin'
That's why I'm doing God's work
I'll hook 'em with the scripture
Then bring it all to life so everyone can get the picture
I'm withcha
See, this is for my folks who hold the fence up
The preachers, ministers, deacons, ushers and the sisters
My granny used to say "Give us our daily bread"
She put it in my heart, and now it's in my head

Make me wanna run away
Pack my bags and get away
On my knees at night, I pray
That we will live another day
You always got something to say

I'm at the park, playin' ball with the children
Providing the league so I can help restore the feeling
It's a blessing to give back, so let's keep giving it
Walk by faith, and showing how we livin' it
Lovin' it, avoiding the hate
Shout out to Ruth for giving birth to Nate
That's my homeboy's momma
We was raised in the Church
We take God with us
Do right, don't fight
Or try to  with us
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
And that's fact, truth mane
The Gospel
Sittin' on the corner, tryna figure the fall
You done got too high, now you're feeling so low
I'm just a nobody, tryna tell everybody
About somebody who can save anybody
I remember what my Grandma said, "Give us our daily bread"
It's in my heart, and my head

Make me wanna run away
Pack my bags and get away
On my knees at night, I pray
That we will live another day
You always got something to say

Just another day in my old neighborhood
Not bad meanin' bad but bad meanin' good

Shot by my head, I popped back and I missed 'em
So I kept shootin' 'til I ran outta shots
Then I threw my gun at him and I ran up the block
Swang them hoes, bang them hoes

Left the city on a mission, tryna better her position
When she did, she never came back
Chase-dime bitches
So I moved on and so did she
She didn't even notice me
At the concert backstage wit' Jodeci
She had a new look, a new face, a new drum beater
And from the looks, I could tell she had been under the needle
Dr. Miami, used to be slim, now she all beef patty
Damn Tammy, I see ya got it goin' on witcha weave too

Get whatchu want, throw it in the bag
Stayed down with' me even when I did wrong

A boss hitta, a boss lady, that's you
Put your face on my right arm, tattoo
Met you, gotchu, get you
You're my angel, God bless you
Who am I in love with? just you
Float on the boat, just us two
Smokin' and strokin', just us two
This is splendid, flex it and bend it
Lay it out for ya
Now let me play it out for ya
You get what she won't cause she don't compare

Carefully, prepared to lay down your life for me
My life would be nothin' with' ouchu

He was gettin' money outta town (O.T.)
I was in the city 'bout mine (you know how I do)
And I knew he was a dog, had to put him on pause
But it happened at the right time (it worked out)
And I know you got drip fast whips and the mansions
But you really need a girl who understands you (for real)
Like when you cash out, know I can too
Yeah I run through the money, I ain't ran through
And I keep it a hunnid
Good head, down bitch, let him get in my stomach (uh-huh)
First lady still married to money
It was like a blind date cause I ain't see it coming
Damn I was on deep, he was still playin'
We was both young till I turned him into a man
Bitches do it for the gram but this really who I am
If you get up in a jam I'mma come through with the bands
Yeah, my type, no stereo (my nigga)
I love you like that woman that carried you back and forth, no merry-go
Die for you like
I ain't speakin' it up, just givin' you a scenario (just playin')
Yeah, I'm goin' to war if it's 'bout you (all day)
It ain't for me then it's not true (no it ain't)
I wanna be the last one you gotta lie to
I got everything I need if I gotchu

The best side

McDonald's all American
There's really no comparing it
I play some D and pop a three and fly up in the air again
First-round draft pick came in with this rap shit
Get a lot of moolah to keep you a bad bitch
Those were the rules, I aimed for the full pie
Took a slice and now I'm popping at the bull's eye
I'm equivalent to excellence
With my weaponry, I'm stepping while I'm rapping it
Now could I should I would I do things your way
And end up dead or in jail? My nigga no way
It's like some good hot head with no foreplay
I won't be  so I cut you like I'm OJ

Whole family had a bag, I'm the plug's cousin
But I found my own plug, the ain't front me nothin
But my nigga Black did give me that Gucci belt (black)
This where I put my heat I never leave it on the shelf (strapped)
My heart froze I don't ever leave it on my sleeves (nah)

Had to take a nigga boo and put her legs up
Her nigga probably do the same with my main thing
Still ride with the flag for the gang gang
I'm a real trap nigga, I don't gang bang
I done been across the map with the propane
They'll point a nigga out get your old man
Put the noodle in her mouth like the low mein
Kill a nigga with a strap like a gay bitch
Made a band in a minute off 8 sips
Tried to walk away from trapping but I can't quit

I don't care 'bout these hoes
I ain't still living in the fast lane
Baby, I've changed a lot

I gave it to you cause you gotta have it
The broadest family is so magic

Meet the one of us

With you on my mind
Rock around a clock, Jay and Beyonce
Michelle and Barack, all of the above
This is black love at its purest
Baby we done been through the forest
I'm talking about growing old with you
Sitting on the porch
Going through storage looking through old photos
When I used to rock the  logo
And you was right there, you still here
So all that arguing, fighting
Let's toast to the night and I need you in my life
And and

Cause you make my life so complete
And that's just how I feel right now for you
So you can take these words as what I say
What I mean
Don't think I'm playing, I'm saying the truth
This is a love song from me to you
Flashy back
Trying to get the passion back
First girl I ever fell in love with
On some East Side long beach  shit
You wouldn't understand it, even if I told you
Baby boom, nigga really love you
As clear as the sky is blue
Ain't nobody in this whole world ride for Snoop, but you
You're so, so

Ladies and gentleman, welcome to the area. This is another east coast, west coast event. My name is Decan Capri. I got my man right here, we slappin' vibe and shit. You know who I'm talking about! Snoop Dogg, Snoop Dogg, Snoop Dogg!

I'm feeling the dough, and now I'm feeling the real
Stunning with the stunner, man, I'm one in a mil
Hold on to my hands while we walk up this hill
There's a mountain and a fountain but the waters are still
Walk in the light but I'm changing drill
Me and my homies gangbang on the field
Take a knee, make a G, follow
Can't you see us kick, Capri?
Back with the Wonder dog
Not the underdog, can't you understand?
Please believe me, I'm with Stevie
Mental wonderland
Or maybe Michael Jackson
Pure satisfaction
Rest in pussy, Hugh Hef
Playboy Mansion
Been a foe, mental fold
Split the difference punk bitch
You on a centerfold
One is soul, never told, forever g
C'est la vie, that's me

And see I'm only here to rock with ya
They tell me that's a good look
See, I'ma keep doing me, 'cause that's all I know
So knick knack paddy wack, Kid Capri and Snoop is back
We do it just it just like this that back (back)

They tried to run a game on a nigga
Word to P.E, shame on a nigga
I never paid attention
Did I forget to mention
I started up cooking up the cavi in the kitchen
Then I graduated, matter of fact I made it
Reinstated but still kept it gang related
I traveled the globe, private jets and Versace robes
Penthouse suites, what about phony hoes?
 glasses, smoke fills the air
And hoes with fat asses playing truth or dare
No bizaar, what a lovely pair
And they all came here just to fuck with a player
Anytime I wanna , shit I'm runnin' through these hoes
Like a pack at the coliseum
Marcus Allen, Bo Jackson, and Bo Diddley
If you know like I know, you come and fuck with me, fo' real

Tell me what you got for me
I'm getting on the good foot
And see I'm only here to rock with ya
They tell me that's a good look

On the rocks, Ciroc, glass and I pour

You can choose best and 2 step to this
Smoked up cause my weed is the shit
Take down and break down the verse
Put the S in your chest when worst comes to worst

Don't disrespect me. Do not disrespect.
I don't disrespect you niggas, I don't bother you niggas. I get my money the way I do. Leave me alone. I don't disrespect you niggas.
Leave me alone. Don't disrespect me. Please, just leave me alone. I'm getting my money the way I do, I'm in my own comfort zone.
Leave me alone. Don't disrespect me. Keep to myself, you keep your yourself. Leave me alone!

Radio, TV, and even the press
They want the meaning of V-A-P-O-R-S
Now the meaning of this word without no doubt
Means nobody wants to be down when you're down and out
Now when you established and got a lot of money
Everybody wants to be your buddy and honey
Like tall buildings they call skyscrapers
(Here comes the vapors)
Can you feel it, nothing can save ya
For this is the season for catching the vapors
And since I got time, what I'm gonna do
Is tell you how it's spreading throughout my crew
Well you all know Nate Dogg, who sings on my records
"Never Leave Me Alone", "Ain't No Fun", now check it
Back in the days before Nate Dogg began
He used to try to holler at this girl named Pam
The type of female with fly Gucci gear
She had a big herringbone with a weave in her hair
When they tried to kick it, she'd always fess
Talking about, "Baby please, you out here serving stress"
Since he wasn't no type of big chronic dealer
The homie Nate Dogg didn't appeal to her
But now he sport boots that match with his suits
Push a Lexus Coupe that's extra cute
And now she stopped fronting and wants to speak and
Be coming round the Pound every single weekend
To get his beeper number she be begging please
Dying for the day to eat these
She caught the vapors

He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

I got a little cousin that's kinda plain
He bring the heat with the beat for the Dogg Pound gang
A mellow type of fellow that's laid back
But back in the days he wasn't nothing like that
I remember when he used to scrap every day
When my auntie would tell him he would never obey
He wore his khakis hanging down with his starks untied
And a blue and grey cap that said the Eastside
Around my neighborhood the people treated him bad
They said Daz was the worst thing his mom ever had
They said he would grow up to be nothing but a gangster
Or either in jail, or someone would shank him
But now he's grown up to their surprise
D-A-Z got a hit record slanging worldwide
Now the same people that didn't like him as a child
Bumping Dogg Food, Doggfather, and Doggystyle

He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

I got another homie from tha L-B-C
Known to y'all as DJ Warren G
He cut, scratch, transforms with finesse
and all that mess
I remember when we first started to rock
He tried to get this job at Calvin's Record Shop
He was in it to win it, but the boss fronted
Said "Sorry Warren G but there's no help wanted"
Now my homie Warren still tried
On and on and on til the like break of dawn
To work at tha V-I-P would be the lick
But they looked right past him so my homie straight dipped
Now for the year after Regulate
Warren G is having papers so my homie's like straight
He walked into the same record shop as before
And the boss be like "Warren, welcome to my store"
Offering him a job, but nah he don't want it
Damn it feels good to see people up on it
Cause I remember when at first they wasn't
Now guess what they caught since he busting
The vapors

He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

Last subject of the story is about Snoop Dogg
I had to work for mine to show I was a true hog
When I was a teenager I tried to be down
But since they wasn't trying to hear me I made the Dogg Pound
I saw a crew on 2-1 street and said, "Can I be down champ?"
They said no, and treated me like a wet food stamp
After getting rejected, I ain't run off the set
I sat and wrote some Dogg doo-doo rhymes at my rest
When I used to go to parties, they'd make me wait
Would have to beg to get on the mic to set MCs straight
I ain't never love no hoes I was just into my music
They acted like I wanted to keep on hanging with the juzi
But now things switched from West to East
"Yo dog do you remember me from 21st Street, G?
We used to see Daz back in the day"
It happens all the time, so brother don't be amazed
You caught the vapors

He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
They caught the vapors



Ayy ayy step back motherfucker, watch out!

La la la la la
We don't give a fuck
Ayy y'all niggas ain't fucking with us, nigga
La la la la la
Imma get it like this nigga


Yo I got the green, Don Juan
I'm in the hood, blow the horn, bom-bom
This pimpin' ain't for free, here's a coupon
My backwoods packs I turn to a futon
I got my eyes on seven figures
And I'mma get it whether I move crooked like Jack Thriller's
I'm shittin' on em, I smell like a winner
Don't hit the bathroom for like forty-forty-five minutes
Redman and we up in this bitch, huh
I never cruise, I work to be the top gun
And I'm a dog off the collar, the marijuana globe trotters
You's got bud, I holler

Ayo this one nigga that roll up that smoke
When I hit the weed spot, my pockets go broke
We high, we high, we high, we high (say it again)
Ayo this one nigga that roll up that smoke
When I hit the weed spot, my pockets go broke
We high, we high, we high, we high (say it again)


It's the four horsemen
Call for reinforcements
We ain't looking for endorsements
We absorb your portions


I ain't here to bring the East back (nah), I'm here to relapse
And now I'm outta rehab they ask me where the weed at
Go get a weed app (homie), I got that weed that have your P.O getting P.O, ask me where to pee at
My G, pack the streets of New York, I give em G-Rap
I'm kool, on the road to riches to get my G back
I'll be that, killer bees mind your beeswax
Past 10 o'clock when ya still don't know where your seat at
Ask big Snoop, it don't take a Crip to see that
Be real, what you read about Meth Man, believe that
I'm nice, I gots no chill, go get a ski hat
In fact, put ya twitter on ice, chill with the feedback


From the days of Cheech and Chong, to Willie Nelson
Everywhere that I go, I blow fo sho, you smelled it
A lot of y'all fuckin' with me, sayin' I'm on your bucket list
But I ain't the one to be fuckin' with
See, I'm like a quick game of tic-tac-toe, take three in a row
Aye lil nigga, go'n hit that door
I'm back with my niggas Earth wind, no snow
And I got the fire on Mt. Kushmore
So let it rain like the leaves of a cannabis plant
When I say it, I mean it as a matter of fact
Well I outta, slip mo dick in your daughter, for starters
Leafs by Snoop, may I take your order?

Ayo this one nigga that roll up that smoke
When I hit the weed spot, my pockets go broke
We high, we high, we high, we high (say it again)
Ayo this one nigga that roll up that smoke
When I hit the weed spot, my pockets go broke
We high, we high, we high, we high (say it again)




Yeah! La la la
What up Snoop?
KRS in the building
Listen! Listen!

Too much brr brr brr
Too many people getting brred
All you hear is brr brr brr in the streets
People grip and they eat just to settle they beefs
Brr brr
Now you getting chased by police
You running to the west, running to the east
But the problem is you under the beast
Brr brr brr - now your brother's deceased
We need peace
Not brr in the streets
The brr in Iraq lasts for weeks
Wack rappers, I'm crushing these creeps
Every time I spit they get weak
Knowledge reigns supreme
I take you back to the days when the telephone used to brring
I'm reading the sacred script
KRS, Battlecat, Snoop in it


Let us begin
What, where, why or when?
Most of my homeboys are dead or in the pen
While I'm at the top, upfront getting it in
Open doors, fuck that cuh, we kick them in
Blast master, blast faster
No more slave mentality, cause now we the masters
Ready for whatever cause you know that they after us
Clear the scene with the beam, cuh, this shit could get disastrous

By any means necessary, peeking out the window
Watching all this sucker shit, look at the pretenders
Thinking how the rap game was
I dig, I dug, I push, I shove, yeah I fell out of love
But it ain't no thing, telephone ring
They don't make 'em like they make 'em when I used to bang
So I try to show the little homies different things
How to diversify, and change different lanes
Learn to read a little, exercise your brain
Mental gymnastics, it's a cold game
Always knew that they would try and trip me, trick me but they couldn't
Cause all my teachers and doctors were curious to the furnace
The honorable speaks
Like Minister Louis Farrakhan my influence is deep
Cause it's truth
What's that? You don't like that?
Well we fight back. And we'll be right back

Let us begin
What, where, why or when?
Most of my homeboys are dead or in the pen
While I'm at the top, upfront getting it in
Open doors, fuck that cuh, we kick them in
Blast master, blast faster
No more slave mentality, cause now we the masters
Ready for whatever cause you know that they after us
Clear the scene with the beam, cuh, this shit could get disastrous




My dawgs don't bark, but they get off
Fuck around and get your whole face bit off
Sinister, spit truth like a minister
So until I'm a monster, when it's the right time
Night time, nigga tryna creep
And keep from dyin' in these motherfuckin' streets
Fuck the police, from a black man's point of view
Spray that shit, say that shit
We right in front of you, each and every one of you
I'm not gon' tell y'all niggas what we gonna do
But whatever y'all did, put two on it
And put a foot on your neck with a shoe on it
Resident evil, it's all on camera and they still don't believe you
Clownin' around, don't come your clown ass 'round here
Nigga you gon' get down
Real talk, I'm leavin' all you clown ass niggas outlined in chalk
Stay black, payback from way back
I'm the homie, 'but the motherfuckin' homie don't play that

And the night will fall, this is death to you all
When the nighttime falls, this the final call
This the final call, call, call

The final call, see reparations will be tooken
Now it ain't no fun when the rabbit got the gun, ha
Motherfuckers, trip this

Cut them motherfuckers off the leash
It's been a week since my dogs ate, let 'em eat
See I'ma tell you upfront and uncut
See I'm a stand up nigga, I'm a man up nigga
Get what I gotta get, a bitch nigga gon' talk a whole lot of shit
Which is the main reason why you stuck around
And I don't fuck around
I'm blowin' new purple in a new circle
I don't wanna hurt you but I will spurt you
And send you back to the earth, you
Came from, game gun
Same one, that I used in another galaxy
Actually, it's all fact to me
If I ruled the world would it come back to me?
Black to me, with my hand on that thang thang
I'm from the home of the brave, land of the gang bang

And the night will fall, this is death to you all
When the nighttime falls, this the final call
This the final call, call, call




Whenever I'm down and out I get back to myself
I roll a motherfucking fat back to myself
Leave it to beaver, America gon' legalize but I ain't believe her
Til she finally did it
Overworked but I'm still committed
All things under the letter G, Snoop Dogg done did it
Gracefully gazing unto the sky
A lot of people smoke just to get by
But I see things much differently
Medically, physically, mentally, theoretically
Put it in a letter so you let it be
One day we'll all agree and have peace up under a big chronic tree
If I had my way at 4:20 every day you could blaze a J
And not have to answer to nobody
I live my life like it's a party
So let's go cuz

So go ahead and blaze up
Today's the day to blaze up (Yeah, yeah ooh)
So go ahead and put your J's up (And smoke)
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana (Get high)
Na-na-na-na-na-nananana


I blaze up soon as I raise up from out of my sleep
I got me a sweet
I hope they legalize it here, I'm tired of police
You think you could smoke like my & Snoop, don't try to compete
I'll still blaze with ya, fire that ho up
If smoking weed is going down, then I'ma show up
Weed is where I'm needed, it's a necessity
If I ain't got it, little shit get the best of me
I even put it in my food, I got a brownie recipe
You eat one piece man your ass'll be fucked up for six or seven hours or so
Then I got plenty of flowers to blow
Smoke it in the paper, cigar, a bong
Don't worry about the haters, just vibe to the song
And do it however you please, you please
Today's the day to smoke weed

So go ahead and blaze up
Today's the day to blaze up (Yeah, yeah ooh)
So go ahead and put your J's up (And smoke)
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana (Get high)
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana


Damn, a pound ain't really nothing now
Remember smoking with my cousin
Now we all Raw cone stuffing
Enough to wake neighbors up
KK my favorite flavor
And you ain't gotta ask cause we major
I smoke like them old players
Only put it in the paper
I just started recently letting niggas smoke blunts around me
Known to keep the room cloudy
Get a bad bitch, sit her down, let her smoke, now she open
The best trees I be smoking
Smell it through the bag so it's potent
Even get it on the plane, TSA don't even notice
Ran in the burner, he done taught a young nigga how to grow it
A pothead but I be focused
And it ain't in my session if it's bullshit
Only the best what you dealing with
It's legal now, everybody's doing this

So go ahead and blaze up
Today's the day to blaze up (Yeah, yeah ooh)
So go ahead and put your J's up (And smoke)
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana (Get high)
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana
Go ahead and blaze up
Today's the day to blaze up
So go ahead and put your J's up
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana na

Come and smoke with me tonight, tonight




Shoot nigga, let me shoot

You know there is always some big mouth-ass motherfucker talkin' shit
There's always some big mouth motherfucker hatin'
Always a nigga hatin', there's always somebody that is displeased with what you do you can never make motherfuckers happy
There is always somebody unsatisfied that feels entitled
There is always some bitch on the side line talkin' shit with her big mouth
There is always some big mouth-ass nigga talkin' 'bout what you shoulda do with your money and what you coulda or would or shoulda, it's just..
You understand me? Big Mouth with your big mouth ass!

You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)

A big mouth, a big mouth
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)

You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth

There's a rumor being spread about me and my crew
About something we did or supposed to do
You might not heard of it yet or maybe you have
But when I first heard it all I did was laugh
I used to get angry and all uptight
You can say what you want just spell my name right
Cause all I'm ever guilty of is rockin' the house
But that's not what the rumor was all about
So if you like to hate tell all your friends
And if you don't wait until you see me again
This way I can hear it from the horses mouth
Right then and there we can straighten it out
Cause I don't get involved with he said she said
So take my advice and quit while you ahead
Because one day I just might not laugh
I pull up and pop a cap in your ass

You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth

People used to say you got a big mouth
Now I understand what they're talking about
Because what we do is just between me and you
And that's something that you ran and tell your crew
But you had to told Sheran and she told Cara
Then the story rolled on just like a wheelbarah
Cara told Bibi and she told  talking to her mam

And somehow my nigga
He told somebody new from town
They called me up and put me down
Now the whole damn show is been changed around
And that's the reason why ain't fuck with you now
Cause you never shoulda open your mouth at all
And I wouldn't have no reason to make this call

You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth

You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth

Now you're the dime dropper of the neighborhood
And everytime I see you up to no good
Just like a snake rollin' on the ground
Looking for some new dirt to spread around
Now you're the dime dropper of the neighborhood

You done made it to see a whole 'nother summer and it feel good
Stop, now, top down through the neighborhood
Let the wind blow, open up the window
That girl is poison like Bell Biv Devoe
We have a barbeque to do at four
Swimming pool party in the back on the low
BYOB, and the plates of food will be laid out for free
Little kids get down, I'll have a bus pull up with Tommy The Clown
Now do The Jerk, get crunk, go to work
And do that dance that'll make your whole damn body hurt
Playing mama dear, calm and clear
This that time of the year
For everybody to be boisterous
Rock with Snoop Dogg and rejoice to this

Shined up my white walls, night falls
I'm feeling hella good
I'm doin thangs that you never would
Like surfin with the sharks, or shootin in the dark
Riding on a bike with my grandson at the park
Evolve while I elevate, take flight, levitate
Breakfast for dinner, I'm cold as a mother, but the summer ain't the winter
Finna, bend a, corner, on a three wheel motion
I'm heading to the ocean, caravan full of cars
Neighborhood stars, up and down the boulevard
We go, till we can't go no more
It's me and mines, it's summertime
You go off and we go on


As we go on (We go on)
Like we do (Like we do)
When it's hot outside (Hot outside)
I just wanna chill with you (Chill with you)

I can send a missile
I got my head on a swivel, swivel
I got my head on a swivel
Eyes peeled when I wiggle
I got my head on a swivel, swivel
I got my head on a swivel
This is not a starter pistol (No, no)
I got my head on a swivel, swivel (Yeah)
I got my head on a swivel
If you need me just whistle
I got my head on a swivel, swivel
I got my head on a swivel


From the depths of the sea
Blowing trees in the big leagues
I got a plan, I'm going ham on all you DBs
You better double me up, safety cover me up
Single coverage won't work boy, I'll burn him up
Give me the damn ball, move the chains at the same time
Dressed to impress when it's game time, flame mine
I'm wide open, hoping, scoping out the sea
Catch a quick screen, cake walk on your whole team
Will he beam, will he run, will he walk, talk, or will he lean
I need riders and goons when I build a team
I get it cracking with the snap of the wrist
It's nothing less than a championship, now peep this

Call a few plays then break the huddle
Check that D, they in the zone no rebuttal
I can throw a strike down the pipe about 80
Hand full of rings, I'm shady like Brady


I can send a missile

I'm in full beast mode, too code to be cut down
Lifting weights, staying in shape, won't be shut down
Antonio Brown or Julio Jones
One on each side, now who do you zone
They on me like a bloodhound cause I won't go down
It's like a merry-go-round the way I'm bending my routes
I'm so sick with this, they can't stick me
Stick to to this
Sports Illustrated, get a flick of this
Lost him, cross him, quarterback toss
Highest point homie had the Randy Moss him
One hand as I shook him off me
Some OBJ with a dab of that DJ coffin, get off me

Call a few plays then break the huddle
Check that D, they in the zone no rebuttal
I can throw a strike down the pipe about 80
Hand full of rings, I'm shady like Brady

I got my head on a swivel, swivel
I got my head on a swivel


If you play wing back, slot end, or receiver
You got to outwork your opponent or you won't receive a
Pass from the quarterback cause he's under pressure
They get a couple 1DB's about to press up
Looking apart from the start, on the dress up
Coach on the play, I'm hoping that he don't mess up
Ayy back up off me, you playing me close
You bout to be hot buttered on a breakfast toast
I rock it out and find my way into the endzone
A couple cheerleaders want to be in my friendzone
I tell 'em "Cool," I keep my head in the game
Cause I'm ahead of the game and I'm a veteran man

Call a few plays then break the huddle
Check that D, they in the zone no rebuttal
I can throw a strike down the pipe about 80

Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden

I used to come through with the tools and Glocks
Party don't rock like it used to rock
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock
I beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks
I used to come through with the tools and Glocks
Party don't rock like it used to rock
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock
I beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks

Standin' amazing, hit you in the brain
Get with Snoop Dogg, he can put you in the game
Put you on the stage, maybe even front page
Get a little fortune, have a little fame
Kill 'em with class, toes to the boogie while you fill up your glass
So quick, so fast
No razzmatazz, I'm just an eastside nigga
With my gangster ass, twenties
I used to pinch pennies
Only Gs, I don't fuck with no
My clique is sick, it expandin'
To outlaws, riders and bandits
What you gon' do
When we coming to a hood near you?

You know I used to come through with the tools and Glocks
Party don't rock like it used to rock
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock
I beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks
I used to come through with the tools and Glocks
Party don't rock like it used to rock
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock
I beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks

What's beef? 'Cause beef is in the kitchen
What you want dog? I'm on a million-dollar mission
How can you get it if you ain't been through shit?
I'm just a seed that was planted by Ruthless
My family tree is so G, we was cut from the cloth called LBC
Crybaby, used to C-Walk at the park
Pitbulls on a leash that would never bark
Real love, real dubs, real
Trip Locc, kin folk, and Wayniac
Peace to the deceased that passed away
"Duces 'n Trayz: The Old Fashioned Way"
What you gon' do
When we pull up in a hood near you?

You know I used to come through with the tools and Glocks
Party don't rock like it used to rock
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock
I beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks
I used to come through with the tools and Glocks
Party don't rock like it used to rock
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock
I beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks

Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden

Yeah, certified official gangsta shit
Unfiltered, like a pack of humps, nigga
Detrimental to all and any that disrespect or deviate from the G calls
It's either hog status or buster status
It ain't no in betweens
You can't wake up and put this on, nigga
Every breath you breathe gotta be committed to this shit
Clappin' niggas, tappin' switches, mackin' bitches
Mansion business and stackin riches
It's all a part of that lifestyle we created back in the days for the world to follow
Gs up, forever
The boss dogg an' Tha General, front line and on the east side

Anywhere on earth, and it'll work

But most of 'em prefer to shoot the K
Yeah, that's the good life
And where we come from, loc, that's the hood life
Where you mama and daddy
Told to set up out the room while they swingin' the caddy
That's on the set, tats on they neck
Streets sweet with the heat, yep, they stay on deck
I'm dazed and blazed, no confusin', I'm choosin'
This how I was raised
I bring that out and bag it up, no doubt
Swing it out and let it up and bang that out
This Crips, nigga

That's crazy, cuz
You know my whole life, I wanted to be a gangsta, mane

Ridin' on bikes but they came with they flags on the end
See Stacey Adams, fine woman

The best in me, nigga, the West to be
A better place for the one of Ace
Put a 9 millimetre in your fuckin' face
And let you say your grace before you have a taste
Of reality, set in, yeah, this your fate
Now your homies at your funeral
Plottin' on some get back
But you can't get back 'cause nigga, you dated
Another sad gangsta story
And usually ones with the territory
No nuts, no glory
No pain, no gain
Life for a nigga growin' up in the game
This slangin' thang
Drinkin', sell a lil' cocaine
Get locked up for a minute now we in it to win it
Now everybody know me
They watchin' the makings of a real OG

Yeah, they say if you watch somethin' long enough, you'll become it
You know, they say imitation is the best form of flattery
That's what I was told
A lot of niggas is imitatin' me 'cause real gangsta shit
You ain't cut from it
You dig?

Yeah, scarin' all the white folk
While stayin' on the right note
And you can quote me if you want to
Don't say what you will do, nigga, what you gon' do?
I'm live in the flesh
Caught him on Imperial left five in his chest
Survive in the west
It's everyday cycle, you never know what might go blam
And how you like me now?

Yeah, man
Do you ever sit and wonder sometimes
What if?
I mean, like, forreal though
I mean, sometimes I just sit and think to myself, like
What if?
I mean, that's a big question, right?
If "if" was a fifth, we'd all be fucked up
But what I really wanna know is:
What if?


(What if?)
We had a reckless motherfucker
That was king of west coast instead of big Snoop Dogg
(What if?)
We never had a nigga like Big P
From the Southside, nigga goin' "woof"
(What if?)
We never had a real woman
That could raise us and teach us, show us what the real was
(What if?)
We had to take it
If you didn't have Suga Free, motherfucker, you had to make it

Social media only ask the he-say, she-say shit
And where would I be without Tone, Pimp  and DJ Quik?
Act like you knew that
I'm glad I had somebody tell me
"Don't think with your dick, boy. Don't do that!"
Come on, you know me, man
I pimp on, I entertain, man
That's why I stay inside my  lane
I gotta be careful when I show you stuff
Cause these haters don't like you if you know too much
Yo, ow give it up if you like this
And you prefer the peace
And won't get mad if you don't have no one to fight with
We pull the cards around a phony
My sister told me, "Niggas act hard around they homies"
Because the West don't need no beef
We need our  and our roaches
And our Reres and our Monique
So stay prayed up, armor on, I got it
What if you talked to that man
And understood before you shot him?


(What if?)
The Bloods and the Crips was the same
And all niggas joined one gang
(What if?)
My granny wouldn't have died
Man, I probably wouldn't have been from the East side
(What if?)
You could do what you don't
And live how you motherfuckin' want, say that
(What if?)
A phony is a phony, a homie is a homie
And you know the big homie don't play that

Catch him, stick him
Rip it, ride it
La di da di, we shout out the party
The old me, the new you, you niggas tryna do me
You better off tryna do you
Boo hoo, voodoo, taboo
DP, GC, what it really do?
I educate when I illustrate
And those the words I be teachin', preachin'
To each and everyone
Never been a scary one
Always been a down ass nigga, clown ass nigga
Reppin' my city,
Extra extraordinaire exceptionally
Never late, predicate, elevate, levitate
My nigga, I'm way too high to ever hate
Papa Snoop in my momma Beverly, heavenly
Thank God for ya'll havin' me, for real


(What if?)
The Bloods and the Crips was the same
And all niggas joined one gang
(What if?)
My granny wouldn't have died
Man, I probably wouldn't have been from the East side
(What if?)
You could do what you don't
And live how you motherfuckin' want, say that
(What if?)
We had a reckless motherfucker
That was king of west coast instead of big Snoop Dogg
(What if?)
We never had a nigga like Big P
From the Southside, nigga goin' "woof"
(What if?)
We never had a real woman
That could raise us and teach us, show us what the real was
(What if?)
We had to take it
If you didn't have Suga Free, motherfucker, you had to make it
(What if?)

Never felt this way before, so I guess I'm-a let it go
Since I'm-a let it go, you better get ready for

This is real pimpin', California, why you runnin'?
The other dudes fakin', baby, I keep it one hundred
Straight shooter with the Buddha, take a hit and get your mind right
Offered me some head, I told that little bitch that I might
In the mean time, let me bust and get my green right
We a hundred deep, goddamn I got my team right
We celebratin' lovin' this life
Your favorite rapper back up on the mizzic
From the underground to the roof, ya'll

All money ain’t good money
But ain’t no money like the show money

We came from the bottom to the top floor
Plus I paid for it it cost a lot though
Money problems everybody got those
But now a days we don’t got those
Birkin bag all my bitches got those
No Chanel everybody got those
Shooters on the roof know we got those
Hear a couple shots, hope you got those

I pull up in a Full Metal Jacket
Pop shots, Top notch with the ratchet
I leave a nigga dead on the asphalt
Slap em in the face tell em take them fuckin’ pants off
T’d Up, G’d Up when we stance off
Two to the chest make a bitch nigga dance off
Goin’ with the Wizzin, Juice with the Gizzin’
Rides til’ I’m Risen, strong with the pizzen'
You don’t know, oh, I fucked your hizzoe
Timbo, the Designer, and finer fuck what it cizzost
See everything I’m rock and wear its handmade
If she with me then she got it all you understand me

We came from the bottom to the top floor
Plus I paid for it it cost a lot though
Money problems everybody got those
But now a days we don’t got those
Birkin bag all my bitches got those
No Chanel everybody got those
Shooters on the roof know we got those
Hear a couple shots, hope you got those

The police, motherfuckin’ gang to me
And money, ain’t a motherfuckin’ thang to me
Let me break it down for you, keep a few shooters
And a damn good lawyer
Preparation for the worst, meditation with this verse
Education, Rebirth, cause you know if you last you first
And everybody wanna be the best, Red bottom shoes for your Louie bag on your neck
Baby remember before you had shoes
When yo’ life was filled with nothing but bad news
See everything I rock and wear is handmade
If she with me then she got it all you understand me

We came from the bottom to the top floor
Plus I paid for it it cost a lot though
Money problems everybody got those
But now a days we don’t got those
Birkin bag all my bitches got those
No Chanel everybody got those
Shooters on the roof know we got those
Hear a couple shots, hope you got those

New cars got that, good weed blow that
Bag bitch yessir, OG for sure that
Used to stay with my momma on the couch
Like the Jeffersons I’m moving on up and I’m out
Penthouse with the butler who waits by the door
To ensure I’m the only motherfucker on this floor
I got game, I got fame, I got cash, I got love
I got so many hoes, I’m bout to open a club
You got me, I got you, you got one, I got two
Stop by and have a good time its popping’ at Snoops
Got a whole lot of this and I mix it with that
Me and Timberland remember we bringin’ it back

We came from the bottom to the top floor
Plus I paid for it it cost a lot though
Money problems everybody got those
But now a days we don’t got those
Birkin bag all my bitches got those
No Chanel everybody got those
Shooters on the roof know we got those
Hear a couple shots, hope you got those

My weed man got the hook up
Rollin' up another pound every time you look up
Big-ass joints, them ones that leave you shook up
So much weight that now I'm doin' kush ups
Kush ups, 'bout to roll a whole book up
Lookin' for me, I was at the crib doin' kush ups
Kush ups, 'bout to roll a whole book up
Lookin' for me, I was at the crib doin'
(Don't stop!)

Tae Bo, five, four, three, two, one
Workin' out, chiefin' up, creepin' up, keepin' up
With the Joneses, smoke a zone with my pen pals
In my neighborhood, flavor's good, roll up, put some papers to it
Straight into it, gon' make him do it, that thing can do it fo sho
Get my lift on, while get my spliff on, fo sho
Break bad, stay cool, way cool, roll a doob
Old school, paid my dues, spray these fools, ladies drool
Cause they know what I got
I got a bag of the Saturday pot
And it'll keep you up from Thursday to Saturday night
What do you like?
When you smoke with the Dogg, you had the time of your life
Now light the fatty, jump in my Cadi
Pull your seat back, yup, I know you need that
Let it flow, set it go, incredible
That ain't gold, layin' low like 10 to 4, on the floor


My weed man got the hook up
Rollin' up another pound e'rry time you look up
Big-ass joints, them ones that leave you shook up
So much weight that now I'm doin' kush ups
Kush ups, 'bout to roll a whole book up
Lookin' for me, I was at the crib doin' kush ups
Kush ups, 'bout to roll a whole book up
Lookin' for me, I was at the crib doin'
(Don't stop!)

Don't even trip
Ain't really gotta use a scale, I could eyeball a zip
So much weight you thinkin', “Why this ain't for sale?”
Weed in my lungs, weed in my nails
She conin' joints, I'm rollin' weed up myself
Don't ever get my weed from off the shelf or my clothes
I heard Polillo 'bout to drop some shit, order those
Pounds, I got more of those, why my eyes sorta low
Not too many when I roll, more arms than Goro though
Boys hatin', I'm just countin' up the money I just made
And what I'm makin' make a nigga make a million dollars later
Smokin' , gettin' high pays
I like my eyes glazed
Ain't empty out my ashtray in days
At my house playin' pool in some HUF socks and Joyrich sweats
I roll a joint, you roll another one next
Can't even name a nigga colder than
Ain't pay for game that mean you stole it then
Know it's the bomb when you hold it in


My weed man got the hook up
Rollin' up another pound e'rry time you look up
Big-ass joints, them ones that leave you shook up

Yes I'm the most high
Baby want it, Mimosa
I tried to reverse her, a mentirosa
Gov me livin' the vida loca in Acapulco
With my pictures on the wall on a poster, a roller coaster
So I try to dance my life away to get it over
I'm sippin' Jamison with famous friends until I'm sober
Don't wanna go home, I know I'm gonna get into a fight
I called my sidepiece and tell her I'mma spend the night
And if she out of town, baby we' gon' book a flight
She got it laid out with incense and candlelights
Your shit's on hit, officially lit
You're tryna get a nigga sprung, your pussy wet, you lil bit
You have no idea, what? You want me right here?
Are you sure that we can do this shit right here?
Cause if it's on like that, I'll spend the night here

Just relax and breathe
You deserve attention, I'm what you need

Good love, good sex and good weed
Baby oil to rub down my sleeves, relax and breathe
Red wine, crackers and cheese, baby shootin' the breeze
While aiming to please
Oh please, don't stop with the antics
High heels, t-shirts, no panties
Me knockin', she's rockin' the boat
While baking me a cake with a root beer float
Then put the TV on the channel where's it's nothin' but sports
Every room at the house is where I smoke my dope, no joke
Got keys to the spot so I can slide by necessary
Mary, Mary, Quite Crip Contrary
Apartment contemporary
Jo Malone candles, very airy
Ain't that right Siri? (That's right Siri)
So keep sendin' that right
The way it's lookin', I'll be spendin' the night

You don't have to leave
You can stay at my house, I aims to please
Just relax and breathe
You deserve attention, I'm what you need
You don't have to leave

No, Snoop can do what he wanna do
(I don't think so)
Don't ask for permission, ask for forgiveness

From mommas, babies, grannies
You gotta love him even if you can't stand him

You niggas don't hear me though
Turn it up, nigga, this shit's in stereo
I walked in with a philly ho
Let me give it to you, young locc, on the really though
Hands, the keys, the Benz, the trees
The birds, the bees, the C's, the G's
I get it like I'm 'posed to, you should be close to me
Right up under my wing
Words I sing, verbs I bring
Bread to the park, head in the dark
Ready with art, I said it with heart
Merely distorted, dearly departed
Look what you started
I'm cool as a mother and you acting retarded
Just what the motherfuckin' doctor ordered
It's the d-o-g with the p-o-p
Not one, not two, but three

I gotta have two or more
Two or more, baby
Maybe even three or four
Like three, like four
Listen to me, baby
I need two or more
Yeah
Maybe even three or four
She likes love, drugs, and sex
Love, drugs, and sex
She likes love, drugs, and sex

Have a seat and don't say one word
Cause you will never catch Snoop Dogg with just one bird
And if I do, I'll probably kick it to the curb
And come anew
Runnin' back, I'm-a keep runnin' through
Hut one, hut two
Down set, hike two, three, four
We go overtime
I'm-a give you something that's gonna blow your mind
And take your time, relax a bit
I came here to mack a bitch
This P is so immaculate
I rap a bit just to taste
Puttin' hair to the snare to the bass
Snap that, Snapchat, flick it up
One of me, three of ya'll, so lick it up
I'm back to the hangin' again, bangin' again
Nigga, could you sing it again?

I gotta have two or more
Two or more, baby
Maybe even three or four
Like three, like four
Listen to me, baby
I need two or more
Yeah
Maybe even three or four
She likes love, drugs, and sex
Love, drugs, and sex
She likes love, drugs, and sex

Freak-a-leek, I speak the truth
I got girls lined up trying to get in the booth
Original, more like a miracle
High definition visual, digital, minimal
But it can be maxed out
Track meet, more meat blow your back out
I had to pull the 'lac out
Cause there was too many of ya'll to be left out
I stepped out mackish with the whole package
Bread with the cabbage, me and a bad bitch
Or two, make it three

Oh na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na

Fat sack in hand, Mac and Dev
Back in dreads, stacking bread
Kush in the air errywhere I be
Word is Doggy Dogg got that 10 a key
You can believe what you wanna loc
See I’ma pee on the tree when I wanna smoke
Underground to the top shelf
And I can do it by my goddamn self
I put some fire on the tip
High when I trip, still fly on a bitch
I’ma ease on by
Tip top, don’t stop, why not, not why
See I’ma regulate it
Real shit, real niggas, real weed separated
And put the match on the tip
So quick, so fast like that, you bitch


If it ain’t KK what you smoking on

Came in this thang, blowing on the strongest Mary Jane
Make sure everybody know my name
Niggas know we go hard so we young bosses in the game
Now I’m getting weed on the plane
It’s such a shame, your bitch with us
Hatin’ on me ‘cause you probably can’t get rich with us
Probably run around claim you a real nigga too
But I’ma fuck her, never call like real niggas do, ooh
No pain, no gain
I be on the yacht drunk sipping champagne
Partying with Snoop Dogg, smoking propane
Screaming rest in peace June Bug with my whole gang
Uhh, niggas hate but I just laugh at that
A milly first quarter, you ain’t half of that
Talking trees, we can go pack for pack
All day, we just smoke back to back


If it ain’t KK what you smoking on
If it ain’t Rosé tell ‘em carry on
It ain’t ‘bout mine ‘less the money long
Oh na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na

Let me be the man and get the money
Baby how that sound?
When I'm feelin' high I'm probably on some light skin
When I'm feelin' low I'm on some brown
Won't you come straight to California
We can get with it, show you how the shit goes down
Know around the world get nasty
And I'm a be right there, right by where the cash be, cash be
And I'm a be right there, right by where the cash be
No, no, no, no, no, no
That's where the cash be


Mula, fetty, you not ready
I'm a get the cheese but the bread was spaghetti
Letti said he can play with them broads
Opportunistic I stay on them hoes
I ain't got time to be handing with y'all
'Specially when there is no money involved

Joint seem mighty long
Red beam on his dome
Point seen money gone


Let me be the man and get the money
Baby how that sound?
When I'm feelin' high I'm probably on some light skin
When I'm feelin' low I'm on some brown

We can get with it, show you how the shit goes down
Know around the world get nasty
And I'm a be right there, right by where the cash be, cash be
And I'm a be right there, right by where the cash be


Robert De Niro, fly as a sparrow
Profit to profit, arrow to pharaoh
El Bueno, hustle like Maino
All money in, no draino
Cato, body, get it like I get mines
Smoke papers, Jamaica, I make it, bake it, shake it, or make it
Never had to fake it to make it
Just put the pedal to the metal rock it up to get flakey
I'm living the fast life
Jet after jet and try to keep my cash right
I know you understand the meaning
Hand full of green and while the fans keep feigning
Straight up, no leaning, I'm right where the chips at
Or even in the hood where the crips at

Joint seem mighty long
Red beam on his dome
Point seen money gone


Let me be the man and get the money
Baby how that sound?
When I'm feelin' high I'm probably on some light skin
When I'm feelin' low I'm on some brown
Won't you come straight to California

Destiny, Melia, Passion
I need y'all to the stage let's go
I need y'all on the stage let's go
Work, work, work

In a white ghost sipping holy water
Always been the type to get it close to porters
After play, Barry Bonds, out the park, I got hits
What you mean? I through the tarp
At the wall, off the wall
I feel like Mike, I don't miss
Niggas talkin' shit
Saying I didn't fuck that pussy into one-nighty
HItting that pussy quit was just aight, uhh
Not at all I ain't get to see the wall
I cocked 'em off, fuck them all
Fuck the law, fuck you thought
I ain't change, seen my chain looks like the car
Flashy man, flashy this and dancing on me
Dirty dancing, dancing like my double cup
Lemonade to niggas that be acting tough
See you got money I just double up
Multiply, fuck addition, fuck your position
Macauley Culkin, rich and riches
This the life, then walk away it's so delicious
Up in Dubai, Sushi hella bitches
Aw man wrote a check, 2 commas, lean lean
Tell em' I need two shots, or two o' clock
Plus that adds about 2000, teardrops
Pull up with my crew in silent nights


I need a girl who will do whatever I want
I need a girl who will do whatever I want

Singin’ a song like, King of the Kong like

If it don’t go right, make sure you all ride
Deuce deuce and a Tec-9 with a .4-5
Niggas is so dead, my nigga I’m so live
Back in my zone like niggas hittin’ my phone like
Shoot him some bail like, cuz he won’t tell right?
The homies don’t act like, the homies don’t act right

Keep the planet spinnin' on it's axis
How is he so hood? How can you ask this?

On the strip, under lights, now I'm back bitch
And even if I'm blown on my own
With the chrome to your dome
Make you stretch like elastic

Bitch niggas staying to the right
I need my tool front and center
Hard on these scores from the Summer to the winter
Spring to the Fall, bitches still on my balls
It's the number one nigga from the hood Doggy Dogg
Still pull up on a nigga when I need to be heard
I'm a killer and a stealer, but I ain't from Pittsburgh
Real niggas on the set, I get your whole clique served
You best observe, a B chalked out on the curb
With your momma and your people sayin' "Supercrip did it"
They won't testify, so he got away with it
Now I'm sttin' on my throne, on my bad phone
I'm talkin' to Iron man, smokin' on fireman
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
Walkin' through the clouds with a Crip stick cane

Super Crip, what?
Super Crip, who?

Damn, I still hear my mama’s voice
"Snoopy get your ass up and go outside and play!"
Hah, if she only knew what I was ‘bout to get off into
Bang!


Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop at all
Don't stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop at all

Don’t stop being you, don’t stop being G
Egotistical, mystical, officially
Shuffle my feet to the beat with my heat in the stash
G in the bag with the C on the flag
We some real OGs baby
I was getting money in the 80’s daily
Niggas like me don’t never quit
And I still go hard on a bitch, ya bitch
You got to tell ‘em what it is, don’t play with the game
I love it when you call a bitch out of her name
Don’t you dare try to save that ho
I know that you like her but you can’t wife her
I’m going on a tour ‘round the world
Probably fuck a whole bunch of girls
Probably get a whole bunch of money, sho’ can you save some for me?
Nah, but you can come and work for me


Don't stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop

Don’t stop being real, don’t stop that rap
Don’t stop showing homies how to shake that trap
I mean I seen so much but I'm still in touch with it
I don’t stop ‘cause I know y’all gon’ fuck with it
We keep going, full speed ahead with this
Niggas ain’t did the shit
Niggas ain’t real as this
We came through and peeled his bitch so quick
From the 80’s with a dope sack in my hand
To the 90’s with a DJ and a microphone stand
Can’t stop now, I’m in way too steep
Tech savvy with this cavy, come way too deep
Short dawg, Snoop Dogg, this for all my dogs
The ones who real in the streets, the ones who locked in the halls
Hall of fame with this game, legendary to y’all
Another 100 point game, now you can bury the ball


Don't stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop at all
Don't stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop at all

Don’t stop getting lit with the shit I spit
I know you’re down with the Dogg, I know you’re fucking with this
Don’t stop, won’t stop, this is all I know
From the uprock to the crack rock in the bowl
Don’t stop getting money, bring that shit back
Don’t stop, fuck a cop for all the times I was jacked
Can’t say much now ‘cause I’m moving a crowd
I’m moving real weight, I mean hundreds of thous
Hundreds of pounds, green leaves
I made it out the motherfucking mean streets
And I still go back and touch the youth
I teach ‘em how to ball and I teach ‘em how to shoot
In the pursuit of my dreams, while recruiting my team
Teach ‘em how to rise to the top just like cream
Remain supreme by any means
Badda bang, badda bing


Don't stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop at all
Don't stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop at all
Don't stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop at all
Don't stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop at all

Look at my reflection
Ain't no second guessing
Born to be a legend
A motherfucking legend

1996, I beat a 187 (murder was the case)
80 million sold, and I ain't check the records
Checked a couple rappers, told 'em not to test me
Ask me who am I? Motherfucking legend
50 bitches naked
Nike ain't my preference
Khaki with the Chucks
Now look how they dressing
Perfecting my profession
Someone call the reverend (Nate Dogg nigga)
Bury me alive, living legend

Even if I die, living Legend
Look at my reflection
Ain't no second guessing
Always be a legend

Look, big dog, six broads, don't matter to me
You knew niggas look madder than me
Came up with the doc, been around the world with 'pac
Don't compare another rapper to me
When I came and kicked them buildings over
Swear I always knew I'd never be the same
Was born to be a motherfucking legend
I ain't never do it for no fucking fame

Motherfucking legend
You know what I'm repping
20 million, 20 years ago
Cuh, you was like 7
You ain't gotta like it
Bitch you gon' respect it (Respek on my name!)
Look me in my eye
Motherfucking legend

Motherfucking legend
Even if I die, living Legend
Look at my reflection
Ain't no second guessing
Always be a legend
A motherfucking legend
Motherfucking legend
Used to whip a Lexus
I can die right now, still a legend
Look at my reflection
Ain't no second guessing
Born to be a legend
A motherfucking legend

Mix purple with the yella
Kobe with Vanessa
Did it doggy style
Like upon the dresser
Look at my reflection
Motherfucking legend
Even when I die




Baby, I come running
Baby, I come running
Just keep me coming
And I come running
Cause I'm your dog
Baby I'm your dog
So whenever you call
I come running


You ain't listenin'
So you can talk to me, don't listen to him
A body like that ain't hard to feed, cause girl I'll eat you up
All in a couple of seconds, girl I'll eat you up
It's when you realize you're in Heaven like how'd you get there?
Baby what you doin' in this chair? Couldn't let you sit there
You need help, somebody should get there
You see girl, time is like money, both of which men loathe
Spend them both with me and then for sure you'll know




She's impressed by a fat boy
Cadillac, weed, pistol on his lap, boy
Home run hitter, thought I was a batboy
Search warrant for the crib, you better get a map for it
Paid for, meanin' I ain't gotta rap for it
She a alley oop, I tap it off the backboard
Hustlin', baby what you lookin' for? Just ask for it
Blue Ferrari, I'm the envy of the task force
Impeccable suits, as I run with my dogs
Pinkie rings and things that come with my wonderful job
Dogg pound niggas, and we came to fight
I was several million up before it came to light
Now they callin' me the truest one to ever do it
Status symbol for the pimps, now enjoy the music
Smoked out like a player and you know the name
Break a bitch quick, really, biggest in the game




I got Rottweiler in tube sock
Pitbull lock on your neck, kiss it and you'll die
Boxer you take mine's off then hallelujah
Shando, count my blessings, spin around two times
Freaky freak like it's the 80s
Fuckin' explicit, radio prolly say we
Should tone it down with the clean version
Dirty but in public you're like teen virgin
I like it make me realize my vices
Enticin', flower bombin' all on your privates
Private meetin' inside your bedroom
Head in that Maybach boomin', thank God for leg room
It's a trophy in that pussy, I'ma cum in first place
I'ma cum in first place, cum in, cum in first place
I'm your D-O-double-G and I need more Pedigree
What it D-O? Puppy chow, I've been grown and so off the leash, ho



Let's forget where we are and what's goin' on
Let's forget who we are and who we know
Why does it gotta be complicated, does it have to be?
Come on baby we can escape, run away with me


You like the way that I dress (you love the way that I see)
You love the things that I do (yes but I love that you are free)
You love the way I think (for people everywhere)
We're approaching the brink but who cares
The world is getting ablaze, yea (x2)


Run away, run away with me
Come and play, come and play with me
Run away, yes do the day with me
Let's escape, yes do the day with me


Let's forget who we were and wanted to be
Let's forget who was there, trust me please
Why does it gotta be complicated, does it have to be?
They won't put their guns away, run away with me






I don't understand why do they live so violently
Let's get closer to the sun, where we're meant to be
Why does it gotta be complicated, does it have to be?
Come on baby no time to waste, run away with me



I knew that, I knew that
You were lookin' at me
That's when the blunt
I knew that, I knew that
You would leave your spot when you got hot
And you're goin' again
I love when you seein' she's goin' to the bathroom
Got 5 minutes to exchange them buds
No I'm not callin' you, what's your sign
I know your name, it must be under cover

Went out tonight, I think of my life
I'm sick and tired of rouge, yea
Then, threw caution to the wind cause F it, who cares
So tonight I'm gon' be


Riding on your, riding on your
Riding on your wave girl
And I feel like, ooh



Thinkin' to myself if I was a freaky dink
What's crackin' homie?
Ain't you ain't gonna see me in this club next week, no
So tonight' I'm gon' be





I'm hoping that you rest and you don't need to sleep
Don't be slacking homie
Grab me by the proof so I don't miss a beat
Baby, so tonight I'm gon' be



And once it all dissolves (to the left)
And it mixes with the music (to the right)
And it makes you wanna do it (to the left)
In a way you never knew it (to the right)


Pass the dutchie to the left
Like it is 4/20
Pass the dutchie to the right
Like it is 4/20
Pass the dutchie to the left
Like it is 4/20
Pass the dutchie to the right
Like it is 4/20
Pass the dutchie to the left

Come aboard the friendly sky's and let it go (cupcakes)
Here's my metaphor (cookies)
You so edible
Lemme know for sure, you squidg your eyes and let it go (chocolate)
You already know (molly)
Its that edible, girl





Come along to the friendly sky's and enjoy the ride (cupcakes)
It makes the music life (cookies)
To get that body high girl
Come along to the friendly sky's you'd be occupied (chocolate)
Off the point of your mind (molly)
Without you feeling inside (cookies)




Badabang badabang
Got a chain you can see through
Graduated to a Range from a Regal
Hit the club and I leave with it 82
That's the difference between me and you
Just how we do it  went straight to the head
On a worldwide tour me and Skateboard
Ate more bitches in the lobby on the molly
Pretty sexy yet exotic fill em all in my Ferrari yep
I'd probably do a menage of 4 and
Got em running upstairs got em coming in pairs
May I relieve you of your jacket can I touch you there
She took off her underwear, it ain't no hair under there
I solemnly swear, I will not share
This game with a lame, let him learn for himself
I owe a nigga shit, better earn for himself
Quit tripping on me, be concerned with yourself



She's 'bout to go in
She likes that low end
Damn, her ass is so big
Just keep it bumpin'
Peaches and cream

She too fly for words
And where I'm at now I'm too high for birds
Shorty what you think about my return?
Cuz what he think about it ain't my concern
I ain't come for you I came for your missus
I don't do it for the haters, I do it for the players
Well okay, I do it for the riches
But in the mean time and in-between time
Shorty right there gon' get it
If she with it if she ain't
Then I know her partner down cuz her partner throwin shots
Every time I turn around, and her partner bringing partners every time I come to town
I'm a G6er, a Maybacher
You can tell the chauffeur he can park it right there
And I'ma walk up to the club upstairs
And when I come down he can bring it back word

She's 'bout to go in
She likes that low end
Damn, her ass is so big
Just keep it bumpin'
Peaches and cream

Uh oh there she goes
That's that look all on her face
Shorty dancing like she knows

Hey, hey, I wanna get with you
Freak, don't fail me now
Hey, so what you wanna do?
Got her freak-um dress on
Them newbies on her feet
And them bottles with the sparkles
So the other girls can see that she's
Paid, I wanna get with you
Freak, don't fail me now
Hey, so what you wanna do?

I came to cut right now
Big Snoop Dogg and I came to get down
Yes, I'm internationally known
Libra lovin' make you moan and groan
Burn my gas like race cars
Two bad broads with the bass on
I never met a girl that I'd wait for
I seal my deal like Jay does
I'm all that and then some
Pimp real for real when I win some
I remember what you're thinking
Black shades on drinking while you're blinking
Something fly, white limousine
Make a clean getaway
I love the clothes, what you about
The way you let it out

She's 'bout to go in
She likes that low end
Damn, her ass is so big
Just keep it bumpin'
Peaches and cream

Uh oh there she goes
That's that look all on her face
Shorty dancing like she knows
She's the baddest in the place
Hey, hey, I wanna get with you
Freak, don't fail me now

Got her freak-um dress on
Them newbies on her feet

So the other girls can see that she's
Paid, I wanna get with you

Hey, so what you wanna do?

Everybody in the world

Fill your body with the smoke
And that's the way it goes

She's 'bout to go in

Damn, her ass is so big

A Dream to fill, scheme for mills, wheels and deals

Catch me lookin' flossy, I done hooked up wit the boss and
Where he got his share of thrust is not my fault

But I'm rough, bossin' up on all them hoes, think I'm a star

Bite off that weed or somethin'
To make it happen is the mission that they send me to get wit
Not all fall out dawg house, I represent this



Lose flash at eleven, eighty six box from the one they seven
New in Denver they beat the bust for ever
One call and make all your relatives forever
Plus your clowns sound funny, it's the deep out honey
Smash with a crash makwe you dash sound funny
So how the motherfucke you gonna pick your lips
To disrespect truth when I run with crips
And that move I know so un cut with it
If you ain't from the lane you never really did it
Pull it, five might make you call
And he burn your sould like stop dropping roll
And I've be there, I've done that, play it loud
Fall back motherfuckers get it off my could
Poof cush what a cuff that's the truth

But that don't mean this time just start to show it baby

So patch it if you want it, I suggest you post on it
Cuz when it's tured up fall back don't do me

State Seattles mean, that's them big boy kicks
The way I mack at a bitch, that's the big boy spit
King of the coach, yeah, I earned my due
Pimp hoes, pimp clothes, yeah, I earned that shoe
Been around the world, did my time in the pen
Niggas in gangbangs is back on them swings
So how could you ever disrespect my place?
Since '93 strong I was all in your face
Big shows in arenas, bitches picker than Trina
Party like rock stars at the bars where I seen her
Made my move closely, you owe me
I had you in the club for 10 years sipping slowly
To my shit classics and all it was was keeping it true
I brought the west back, what did you do?


Ain't nobody better than me
True hood rock star in me
Ain't nobody better than me
S-S-N-double O-E

Slow motion in the fast lane
Feeling so alone blowing domes in the crap game
Sitting at the top of the game where you ain't
Got every type of car so now I just play the paint
Show after show, bank row in the Rolls
Living nice, big slice, got me slamming cans a doors
Three piece suit with a pocket watch
Snoop comin on, you all riding chrome like you gotta stop soon
Did it the G way, he say, she say
Peer pressure to me, way to stop, bang in the seat way
I was the hog in the streets
Got in the game and broke the law on these beats
The slow flow killed and people said I rapped like I was chilling
Way above the stars, Snoop Dogg is top feeling
Plastics and all it was was keeping it true
I brought the west back, what did you do?



Who get it like I done it? (Nobody)
You just in it, nigga, I run it
I gave life to the game and you behind on your bills
Like I can't get in your grill cause I live in the hills
Snoopie this, Snoopie that, yeah, I heard what you said
Ungrateful ass nigga, all the kids that I've fed
Young ass buster, let me see your ID
I just chunked up a bill passing VIP
I gave niggas a lane to represent that G-A-N-G-S-T-A on me
Been crippin', been pimpin', been doing the do
See me walking and that whole world doing it too
They play follow the leader, boss on the move
Shot down to the shoes, man I brunk on shoes
Cotis at the mall, I've been keeping it truth
I brought the west back, what the fuck did you do, nigga?



Lay low, getting' this weed money, me and my cous'
Yeah, you know how we do
But I wanna hold that baby for a minute now
See, about to knock 'er
See what it takes for her to be knocked
What it is, trip


Baby, what's yo' pleasure?
I be there for you, baby!
Even through stormy weather


Huh, what did you prefer, let me accommodate
To get you turned up, to get your head straight
We started off with a quote, and now it's about an eighth
When you and Ali back, I blow it in ya face
I could tell that you high because you laughing
You took a dab of that wax girl, you blasting
She wants some cake in her system, she take a shot of that
Moscato with the lemon, yeah, with a shot of yeah
Man, that's a hell of a combination, put you on your back
She take three more shots, I said you dig that?
Now she in the mood tonight to get freaky
I can tell that she buzzing, she getting kinky
Yes, she loving  she take a dab
Its me and one girl and Snoop in dial
Hit the stormy weather, yeah, it's fifty below
We in a smoke storm, baby, light it up and let's go!



See, that's why we push it
And go faster
Tell me how to get it on
If you got the septic on the phone
We go and smoke it off to this door?


Girl I wanna smoke wit ya
You wanna smoke wit me
The first time I'm feelin out your fantasy
It's the man in me
And the woman in you
To make us do the things we do
We got something in common
I don't know what it is
We can be lost or we can be free
Now I did like many ladies in my day
But just like the smoke, they got blown away
Like a glass of wine, sit back and rewind
But back into time, let the feeling rewind
Now, I don't know what it is and I don't know what it was
But it's DPG, me and my big cuz




Guten tag, Ich liebe
Ich keine
Oh mein God
Ich glaube kommen

Ich swear to God


You know my story
I did a lot of balling
Been around the world
A lot of girls calling
A lot of panties falling
Out the air and on the stage
If my life was a book
You wouldn't miss a page
But none of that really matters
When I
Seen her pass by
I damn near dropped my folds
I'm like Snoopy breathe
Kush had me gone
I couldn't think straight
Pimpin' was all alone
Shoulda seen her walking
Like a model do
If this was Twitter
I would follow you
Open your world to new things
Let Doggy take your hand
I'm seeing wedding rings
Call Diddy lets make a band
She got me hot
I don't want to leave
I seen the world's best
But she's something to see
And now I'm on a plane
Feeling so ashamed
I couldn't catch her name
I call her Miss Everything


Tell me have you seen her (Seen her)
Five something, pretty face, and them big brown eyes
Small little waist
When the floor goes tremble
Make a grown man cry
Oooh
I keep
But the numbers never got exchanged
Every town, every city
Got a, a Miss Everything
Miss Everything (Miss everything)

You know my story
I rocked a lot of crowds
Sold millions of records
I love my fans so loud
I got a thousand cars
And all hopes of bein'
A real superstar
I live super far
But none of that really matters
When I caught my eyes in Spain
She walked into me
Like you did your thing
In that Spanish accent
The one I love so much
She looked like an angel
One I wanted to touch
I blinked my eye for a second
And then she disappeared
When I see that Pretty Woman
I felt like Richard Gere
Boss dog ain't never been one to watch it pass
Unless we in they room, and they leave
And I watch that ass
But baby something else
Somehow I didn't speak
I been a player so long
Maybe I reached my peak
And now I'm on a plane
Feeling so ashamed
I didn't catch her name
So I call her Miss Everything



Yah, you know my story
I seen a lot of hoes
A lot of gold diggers
Luda call them pros
I don't call them back
And thats just how it goes
Most people call me Snoopy
Or S-N-double-O
But none of that really matters
When I was in New York
I had a show at The Garden
You know, poppin' corks
That's when I seen her
From a distance
She smiled and froze
Now everything I learned in the game
Told me she chose
And I don't miss a beat
This time I gotta speak
She looked magnificent
Like something to eat
Hey co, I can't let her go
I made my way through the crowd
Let's get out of here
Head to Filipe Childs
Lotta stars in place
Doggy set the mood
I'm like "I like your style"
She's like "I like yours too"
Before I
I gotta know your name
She smiled as if she came
Call me Miss Everything

Smoking everywhere I go and everyday I’m in the press
Flyin in on the jet, hit the tarmac
In a whip that you can best bet

And if my hair wasn’t locked up I’d go and get a wet set

Talkin loud and you sayin nothing

If he lose baby he gonna gain another dough
What a brother know, keep it on the low
That’s what my grandma said it suppose to go
Feel the same, we toast and post it
And if it all work soft then we casper the ghost
Me and damn phone we capture the phone
Collusion, illusion, set it all foe
Plan with me, for your best, let it all go
The beach and the wind you blow

Feels so real and my mind won’t let go
Let it go, you got to let it go
It feels so real but my mind won’t let go
Let it go, you got to let it go

In my mind I know
There’s no room without you
And you know, you know that we
That we belong together
You got the upper hand on me


Feels so real but my mind won’t let go
Let it go, you got to let it go
It feels so real but my mind won’t let go
Let it go, you got to let it go


I came to funk wit you one time
Making everybody wanna get up
This is the way we funk, yes sir
Making everybody wanna get up

I said it slow, so let it go
This is what we headed for
Once in a lifetime, you’re my lifeline
Baby boo on the real, it’s the right time
For us to let it out
And move you back into my house
And show you what this lovin is all about
I really didn’t think that I can turn you out

In your mind you know
There’s no room without me
And I know, I know that we
That we belong together
I got the upper hand on me


And it feels so real but my mind won’t let go
Let it go, you got to let it go
It feels so real but my mind won’t let go
You got to let it go, you got to let it go


I came to funk wit you one time
Making everybody wanna get up
This is the way we funk, yes sir
Making everybody wanna get up


Feels so real but my mind won’t let go
Let it go, you got to let it go
It feels so real but my mind won’t let go
You got to let it go, you got to let it go

Feels so real and my mind won’t let go




Yeah.. so funky..


Niggaz hit the pavement, when I come thru slow
in a six-fo', hangin out the window
Niggaz hit the pavement, when I fall thru the club
Chuckin up the dub on you scrubs
Niggaz hit the pavemment, D-F on the beat
If you don't work, then you don't eat
Niggaz hit the pavement, real true statement
Grind 'til they pay me, real niggaz hit the pavemennt


I'm in the coke white BM
Just clocked in at 11 p.m.
Uh, while I'm blowin my meds
Most of y'all niggaz prob'ly goin to bed
I'm out in the red, comin back home with the bread
Handle my medal, Hansel & Gretel
Cheese, keys, breeze, and settle
This shit hot like a pot or a kettle




Droppin Cs' for the Gs, poppin my Ps'
Dottin my Is' while crossin my Ts'
Me and Dam spittin game, doin shows overseas
40 years old, have no fuckin enemies
Check cheddar, ber-etta let 'em mo' wetter
If you knew better then you'll prol'ly do better
Act like you know, know not better know better
Cause..




I live with a maid
Won't be happy 'til my whole team paid
From my momma to my daddy to my kids to my wife
And all my kinfolks in the afterlife
I'm chillin on the moon like Mac Tonight
Bigg Snoop Dogg got 'em actin like
Money is the key to end all your woes
Mo' money, mo' hoes




Keep mashin with this funk y'all, keep mashin
Keep mashin with this funk y'all, keep mashin
Keep mashin with this funk y'all, keep mashin
Keep mashin with this funk y'all, keep mashin
(Niggaz hit the pavement)





Groove thang, groove thang, groove thang
Yeah, cause I be rockin' my two chains
And I do things, and I do things
Yeah, cause I be all on my groove thang
My groove thang, my groove thang
Yeah, just watch me now in my groove thang
My groove thang, my groove thang
Yeah, cause I be all on my groove thang
Yeah, just watch me now

Too hippy to be cut-throat - hippies blow the best smoke
Rollin' up RAWs and living royal
All my and bays & jays is loyal, they won't leave me cause I spoil
The baddest of them all, the hash is why I won't fall
Molasses can't match my crawl, I'm higher than all of y'all
They sayin' they born to ball, I'm sayin' I'm Santa Claus
Funny jokes I tell all, always inhale fog
Nappy dreads, my hair long - Diamond 5-foot bong
Could never be a clone



It's a new thang and a new look
Kids be makin' our names in the book
Who you wanna be when you grow up?
The Broadus Boyz, we actin' up
We showin' out and we show up
We ballin', it's all we know, it's not an option
You see us, and yes, we poppin'
Standin' tall, we not fallin'
On top, and yes, we callin' shots
What you thought? I'm in charge and I'm the boss
Do a show and then we shop for the flyest gear
We up in here, dippin' and dodging, man, changing gears
This the life we chose, so you gon' hear this all year




Oh, it can't be right
"How come?" meets the end
Before you leave me, say a word
And it's a waste of time
I know that I change
The way your heart picks the ones you love


What's the difference when you say all the words?
You'll still be with her, and I'll be fighting for more
What's the difference when you explain she's the one?
No, I don't think straight - cause I'm a woman who's madly in love

You should say goodbye
But baby, it wouldn't even matter
the way I'm losing love
They say it'll pass
But lately I don't even bother to leave the light on



Have you ever seen a woman go from frantic to calm?
Like real fast? Let me explain


Don't ever snap on me what? Over forty nigga! what!
You know I'm what? I'm doin me and what?!
Still look good too and what? Nigga you see me? You see me man

Kids! This is why I'm hot
Playboy approach me wrong, this is why I shot
Huh! Ball! I get the game from my pop
'Til everyone know my name the game don't stop
Now! Not! So I keep pumpin the block
Until I'm big as Rihanna and Mason's rock
While you love Sosa
I'm over here lovin this RG3 Redskin that's on my sofa
Her ass alone man bigger than Oprah
Puerto Rican, Dominican first name Rosa
Anyway, let me explain one time
Uzi, we up in here makin a movie
Check Slate, it's a wrap

Hey! Hey! Let me explain this
Hey! Hey! Let me explain this

Let me just slip into the back of the wide
Open your eyes let your window down now you in the passenger side
Get in, now you get it, quit it and with it
Waan come test me now tell 'em the Lion did it
And bit 'em off a chip of the block of the wood
Lil' homie couldn't rock if he could click cockin and pull
Hip hopin over lot of the bull more pull
And yes, I am paid and full
Fa schizzay, my nizzay, Erick D-i-iznay!
That's all I'm a sizznay, okizzay
'Cause I'm too mean too cool too cold too slick
Hey! Hey! Nigga look real quick
That nigga Snoop about to take yo' bitch

Hey! Hey! Let me explain this
Hey! Hey! Let me explain this
Hey! Hey! (SAY IT WITH YOUR CHEST!)
(LIL' ASS NIGGA! SAY IT WITH YOUR CHEST!)


Hey! Hey! Nigga look real quick!
Hey! Hey! Nigga look real quick!
Hey! Hey! Nigga look real quick!
Hey! Hey! Nigga look real quick!

Yo! Like a room full of black of raw heat
They see the flow back gettin all geek, It's like I'm Pete Charles I'm all street
They come in time money but talk cheap
But rappers wanna kick it I'm all feet
Every line artistic that's all me, my man's son autistic that's so key
The why go and get it I'm so G
That's why I wear the fitted so low key, that's why I kill the critic for no fee
Then tell the judge I did it and go free
E double E my co-d
Let's throw the book at 'em what's yo' plea?
Guilty as charged that's how it is when your guilty and charged
Took a bunch of Def, artist and built me a Squad
What's today's math? Build with the God, weed, women and cars
Lock the game down I'm givin 'em bars
What is life if you ain't livin it large? If you ain't livin it large
Go get the price checked and get you a job
But wait


Hey! Hey! Let me explain this
Hey! Hey! Let me explain this
Hey! Hey! (SAY IT WITH YOUR CHEST!)
(LIL' ASS NIGGA! SAY IT WITH YOUR CHEST!)


Hey! Hey! Nigga look real quick!
Hey! Hey! Nigga look real quick!
Hey! Hey! Nigga look real quick!
Hey! Hey! Nigga look real quick!


Yeah!






Is it because I'm black?
Somebody tell me, what can I do?
(Cause their ain't enough bars
To hold the the drama that we've been through)

Right here, right now, I do declare
That I'm more than a gangster, mack, pimp or a player
I swear I ain't never told on nobody
It started in '82 at a 'hood house party
Half Ded, Lil' Loc and my nephew D
Not knowin' what we do, but this is RTC
Heart sparked, puttin' flags in Tucane Park
I leave the house for school, but I come back after dark
You feel me?



More power, more leadership - unifying Bloods and Crips
I used to smoke a pack a day, I used to have to pack a K
Now I've got brothers in suits in my faculty
Pushin' peace in the streets - North, West, South and East
Student of the game, yeah it's time to make a change
So I'm following, no more swine swallowin'
I'm gon' just walk the walk of a righteous man
Try my best to rewrite this plan
As-salamu alaykum, sir
Yeah, that's the plan



Yeah, I'm down with Obama just to add a little drama
And I'm rollin' with the Nation, but I've been doin' that
Had a talk with my mama, had to let her know that I'mma
Make a change, and she said: "baby, go ahead and do that"
Farrakhan is a prophet and I know it cause he show it
And he told me, so I'm teachin' brothers how to be peace
What's wrong? We too strong, and if we all get along
They could never penetrate us, all they do is motivate us
Haters

The enemy is always watching for leadership that will rise among black people because it is only by organizing effectively that you can change the reality under which we live



Quick draw - I'm fast on my heat
Buckle up and take a ride in my passenger seat
Put your feet to the pavement, look at my behavement
See how, the be how, and trip what I was raised with
Can't no nigga fade me, bangin' like the 80s
Had a lot of money with a handful of babies
Boy, this shit is crazy - straight from the turf
Hit the red alert and ask Mack it better work
So I slide to the spizot, right behind the lizide
And get a bag of pizot, avoid getting hizocked
Cause hizabs is on me, they want me, but I can't fold
I'm an Eastside rider, I was born to roll
Never tell to be told, never sell to be sold
On the level, what a rebel, boy, I stay in control
And I'mma let you ride with me so you can see how it goes
And we'll hit the track and let you peep out some hoes
And if you like what you see, and you agree with me
Then you enjoy my perspective of the LBC
Kick back and roll up, and mix the Henny with the soda
We ridin' like we flyin' through the system of solar
And the aroma of doja, the atmospherin' we hearin'
Since I'm the driver I'm ridin' with rear-end super suspension
The misson can't be completed 'til you get that vibe
Now you're mobbin' to the beat on the passenger side

Lean back, roll up, this is how it go
Windows down, music up, this is how we blow
Lean back, roll up, this is how it go
Windows down, music up, this is how we blow

We in the tre, so I'mma dip it slow
Next stop is the liquor store
Last sip, pour it back
So good, I had to get some more of that
Yeah. And now we on tizilt
Interior, mizilk - exterior, sizilk
Okay, okay, alright - say it like all day
In the tre with the dawgs, that's the player life
How you feel now?
I know - you probably want the wheel now
But I can't and I ain't, so just roll up some more of that dank
And pour some more of that drank
And hand me that CD so I can let the shit knock
Live in the drop
You can hear it when we comin', we speedin' up the block
While we're beatin' up the block, it's 'bout to go down
Slip-sliding, rip-riding with my broham, haha

Lean back, roll up, this is how it go
Windows down, music up, this is how we blow
Lean back, roll up, this is how it go
Windows down, music up, this is how we blow

Lean back, roll up, this is how it go
Windows down, music up, this is how we blow
Lean back, roll up, this is how it go
Windows down, music up, this is how we blow

Keep your family straight, and watch  continue to grow
(This is Serious business)
For the generation after you
(official business)
And beyond
Now that's gangster


Break up to make up, wake up to cake up
And spanky-danky with me, we gon' bake up
Null and void, modest toys
I'm proud to present to y'all the Broadus Boyz
And we gon' ball 'til the day we ball
Ball 'til the day we ball
We gon' ball 'til the day we ball
We gon' ball 'til the day we ball

Top Dogg - Basset Hound
A dream of mines is to pass it down
To my two boys, cause I remember back
When they used to roll with me, sittin' on my lap
Doin' photo shoots for Jet magazine
Shout-out to the boss lady, yeah, that's my queen
What a team, it's all in fun
Now the story be Cory B, no guns
Point blank, yeah we gettin' bank
We on Instagram, takin' pictures with my fam
Superfly
Now everybody and they mama tryna get that application Snoopified
So they can float with us, and go with us and roll with us
But we ain't really trippin', that's what's wrong us
And how they get along with us
Got the whole world tryna do a song with us



We ballin', we swishin' and goin' on missions
Headed to the right position, like the top, like where them blimps is
Got a lot of ambition, zoomin', changin' transmission
Got 'em lookin', like "who is this?"
It's them Broadus Boyz, boy, we makin' noise
Sit back, listen and enjoy
Champions repeating
Y'all not winning money Ten, we undefeated
Million-dollar business Menace rippin'
Cali livin' on the beach with palm trees
A hundred deep, lookin' like an army
We feelin' the breeze, the ballin' nothin' to me
Been doin' this since a youngin
You shootin' lay-ups, we dunkin'
7-calorie bumpin', keep it live and keep it jumpin'
In the junction pop-poppin' with the youngins
We keep it 100, he on top of his money
Ballin' 'til we ball, Summer to Fall, we hotter than all
On the loose, we the truth in the booth, dippin' in the Coupes
 Pops and Lil' Snupe
We've got the juice



Me and my brother loop on
We don't fuck with them coupons
We dip OG in fruit punch we don't care where you from
Come from where niggas do bring guns
But the only gun I got is my doobie
My life is on tour so my life is a movie
Goin' to shows, tryna roll, doing everything, weary
Though she gotta be wishin' that she could fuck with this pimpin' (Hol Up)
Cause it was taught, not given
Y'all life is bought, not livin'
And maybe that's what's the difference, I'm still in the kitchen
Cause cops still in my business, throwin' rocks at my bitches
Dog, I'm livin' the livin', dog
I'm just livin' the livin'
So the cops in my business
The bitch got different feelings
It's that lane switchin', doobie twistin' young brother 'bout his business



Late night, hangin' on the corner (Gangsta, Gangsta, Gangsta)
East Long Beach, California
Daytonas when I run up on ya
Real dog, bitch, tryna catch a boner
I get what I get, I'm a goner
And smoke more dope than a stoner
I sip what I sip when I sip
Don't flip when I trip on a bitch, 'cause I'm on one
Haul ass for the cash
Snoop Dogg came back for your ass
Grass and trees, ass up, bitch, on your knees
Do what I please
I break the bitch slow
Take her, make her get more
Even if she never sold her pussy hole before
It's a slow process
Rub my fingers up your dress
Hold these nuts, it's a test
Hide this package in your breasts
Don't say no, always say yes
You are my, my best
Oh yeah, what it do?
That's why I wrote this song for you

All my bitches, all my hoes
Fly ones, tight ones, and even the white ones
All my bitches, all my hoes
Gang intervention, in your position
All my bitches, all my hoes
Don't say shit, bitch, keep it on the low
All my bitches, all my hoes
For the Dogg, protocol, you know

I won't get caught, I refuse
A nigga just chose, so I choose you
Really not tryna confuse you, or abuse you, or misuse you
It's back to the bed frame
Real P.I., all in your head game
I said it slow - woo-op, boo-op, now let it go
I got the bitch that makes the most cash
I got the bitch that's got the most ass
She's a lawyer with a visa
So I blaze my trees up
And she'll help my keep my Gs up
And that's what it do
That's why I wrote this song for you

All my bitches, all my hoes
Fly ones, tight ones, and even the white ones
All my bitches, all my hoes
Gang intervention, in your position
All my bitches, all my hoes
Don't say shit, bitch, keep it on the low
All my bitches, all my hoes
For the Dogg, protocol, you know

Yeah, gimme some gangsta shit curr
Some of that hood shit
Coming up
How that sound

I've been doing this shit since day one
Yeah nigga, day one, day one yeah

Let me, let me tell you what your worth is
Wake up in the mornin with a purpose
Only you can make me happy, surface
East side long beach baby, the turf shit
The place where I lurked at
13 on the scene getting bent back
With a whole lotta snake venom
Used to steal annihilators out the highway center
Up early getting shit started
Back flippin', trippin', tippin', crippin' cold hearted
Way before I got high man
Both double up 15s from the pie man
Heat out the motherfucking frying pan
Little kids love Snoop, fuck IronMan
I'm a vet on the set I ain't lyin man
Let me show you how fly I am
Play in the school, lay in the pool
And I stay in the cool
Young loc I ain't playin with fools
Reset, repeat
Unlock and recock
The heat and it gets so fast
Spend yo cash
It will get in yo ass
Now the question is this for now
Are you really in love with that bitch yo?
Another man's trash is another man's treasure
What's your pleasure?
Looking at you straight from a falcon eye
On my balcony, asking how can I?

How can I love somebody else
When I can't love myself enough to know
Bad 4 me, a lot of G's start snitchin'
Bad 4 me, Fuckin with you hoodrat bitches
Bad 4 me
All that you had 4 me, was all bad 4 me

Curr I used to run with struck out gon' away
Cold things is he called me on the phone today
Told me he was up for release
Its been about a dub since cuz seen the streets
Yeah loc, shit don' change
Long Beach don' flipped crazy durange
Everybody sellin' out, word of mouth, the OG's tellin' now
I drove there the other day
To chop some game with my big homie Donald Ray
Its sort of hard for me to run away
Step out my car no gun today, underlay
I press my luck, if I get stuck, well then thats whats up

How can I love somebody else
When I can't love myself enough to know
Bad 4 me, a lot of G's start snitchin'
Bad 4 me, Fuckin with you hoodrat bitches
Bad 4 me
All that you had 4 me, was all bad 4 me

The true definition of that mixtape

How can I love somebody else
When I can't love myself enough to know
Bad 4 me, a lot of G's start snitchin'
Bad 4 me, Fuckin with you hoodrat bitches
Bad 4 me

Back up on my good foot, feelin like an actor
Back in '88, sold yogurt out the wrapper
Then I became a rapper
Money up front but I guide it up to back er
New shoes, new clothes
All for the fuck of it
Played my cards right so it's safe to say I struck it rich
Givin back, takin care of everybody
I'm doin bad, homie don't you worry bout it
Walk the walk and try to talk the talk
I'm tryin to give you more than just food for thought
If you movin while you grooving
Hopin' that you won't get caught
Never let em know about it
Only let em hear about it
Hit that paper, read about it

I'm in the D-Town, droppin' off a sea hawk
Hit her with some G talk
And slide off with that east side long beach sea walk, ya dig?

Rude boy you in the Kingston
Bad boy in New England
New York the whole kingdom


I ain't got the remedy

I heard the boy is sinnin and they die for me


Wadadadang wadadadadang

As I take a look down the boulevard
Fun of get to you, life is very hard
So many faces bearing the battle scars
But love I bring to the people
Coming straight from the heart
If crisis is what we see
All over the world is pure controversy
One man can't put the price pan humanity
It seems like the whole world's gone crazy


Everybody knows Johnny came from the roughest part of town
Survived the School of Hard Knox but still came up and made his chips
The realest life, never watch it down
Walk with a gun through the heart of town
We hearin bam bam bam, a familiar sound
To the youth down in the gully where Johnny boy done grow
He never thought that he would make it out
It's crabs in the barrel down in ST close


As I take a look down the boulevard
Fun of get to you, life is very hard
So many faces bearing the battle scars
But love I bring to the people
Coming straight from the heart
If crisis is what we see
All over the world is pure controversy
One man can't put the price pan humanity
It seems like the whole world's gone crazy


Poor Johnny Johnny got stuck for his money
Things get funny when you rump with the daddy
Later on the goons pull up in the black Caddy
Next step on the news them find another dead body
Tales for the inner city
We break it right down to the nitty glitty
Who's responsible for the crime and poverty?
What a tragedy
Wayoo


I wish that I could singlehandedly free the entire planet
Turn from crying man poverty
Love me when the love he say they near
When we burn real seize and jealousy unheard
And you take me one, you are part of this effect
Come into slavery, we would be emancipated
If they break our eggs then co-operate
Not a gyal stop me from achieving the greatest

As I take a look down the boulevard
Fun of get to you, life is very hard
So many faces bearing the battle scars
But love I bring to the people
Coming straight from the heart
If crisis is what we see
All over the world is pure controversy
One man can't put the price pan humanity
It seems like the whole world's gone crazy
